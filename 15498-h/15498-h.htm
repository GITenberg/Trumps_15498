    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; SCHOOL BEGINS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Forty years ago Mr. Savory Gray was a prosperous merchant. No gentleman on
      &lsquo;Change wore more spotless linen or blacker broadcloth. His ample
      white cravat had an air of absolute wisdom and honesty. It was so very
      white that his fellow-merchants could not avoid a vague impression that he
      had taken the church on his way down town, and had so purified himself for
      business. Indeed a white cravat is strongly to be recommended as a
      corrective and sedative of the public mind. Its advantages have long been
      familiar to the clergy; and even, in some desperate cases, politicians
      have found a resort to it of signal benefit. There are instructive
      instances, also, in banks and insurance offices of the comfort and value
      of spotless linen. Combined with highly-polished shoes, it is of
      inestimable mercantile advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gray prospered in business, and nobody was sorry. He enjoyed his
      practical joke and his glass of Madeira, which had made at least three
      voyages round the Cape. His temperament, like his person, was just
      unctuous enough to enable him to slip comfortably through life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for his own comfort, he had but a speaking acquaintance with
      politics. He was not a blue Federalist, and he never d&rsquo;d the
      Democrats. With unconscious skill he shot the angry rapids of discussion,
      and swept, by a sure instinct, toward the quiet water on which he liked to
      ride. In the counting-room or the meeting of directors, when his neighbors
      waxed furious upon raking over some outrage of that old French infidel,
      Tom Jefferson, as they called him, sending him and his gun-boats where no
      man or boat wants to go, Mr. Gray rolled his neck in his white cravat,
      crossed his legs, and shook his black-gaitered shoe, and beamed, and
      smiled, and blew his nose, and hum&rsquo;d, and ha&rsquo;d, and said,
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo;
      and held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Savory Gray minded his own business; but his business did not mind
      him. There came a sudden crash&mdash;one of the commercial earthquakes
      that shake fortunes to their foundations and scatter failure on every
      side. One day he sat in his office consoling his friend Jowlson, who had
      been ruined. Mr. Jowlson was terribly agitated&mdash;credit gone&mdash;fortune
      wrecked&mdash;no prospects&mdash;&ldquo;O wife and children!&rdquo; he
      cried, rocking to and fro as he sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jowlson, you must not give way in this manner. You must
      control your feelings. Have we not always been taught,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Gray, as a clerk brought in a letter, the seal of which the merchant broke
      leisurely, and then skimmed the contents as he continued, &ldquo;that
      riches have wings and&mdash;my God!&rdquo; he ejaculated, springing up,
      &ldquo;I am a ruined man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was. Every thing was gone. Those pretty riches that chirped and sang
      to him as he fed them; they had all spread their bright plumage, like a
      troop of singing birds&mdash;have we not always been taught that they
      might, Mr. Jowlson?&mdash;and had flown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      To undertake business anew was out of the question. His friends said,
      &ldquo;Poor Gray! what shall be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendly merchants pondered and pondered. The worthy Jowlson, who had
      meanwhile engaged as book-keeper upon a salary of seven hundred dollars a
      year&mdash;one of the rare prizes&mdash;was busy enough for his friend,
      consulting, wondering, planning. Mr. Gray could not preach, nor practice
      medicine, nor surgery, nor law, because men must be instructed in those
      professions; and people will not trust a suit of a thousand dollars, or a
      sore throat, or a broken thumb, in the hands of a man who has not fitted
      himself carefully for the responsibility. He could not make boots, nor
      build houses, nor shoe horses, nor lay stone wall, nor bake bread, nor
      bind books. Men must be educated to be shoemakers, carpenters,
      blacksmiths, bakers, masons, or book-binders. What <i>could</i> be done?
      Nobody suggested an insurance office, or an agency for diamond mines on
      Newport beach; for, although it was the era of good feeling, those
      ingenious infirmaries for commercial invalids were not yet invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried Jowlson, one day, rushing in, out of
      breath, among several gentlemen who were holding a council about their
      friend Gray&mdash;that is, who had met in a bank parlor, and were talking
      about his prospects&mdash;&ldquo;I have it! and how dull we all are! What
      shall he do? Why, keep a school, to be sure!&mdash;a school!&mdash;a
      school! Take children, and be a parent to them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dull we all were!&rdquo; cried the gentlemen in chorus. &ldquo;A
      school is the very thing! A school it shall be!&rdquo; And a school it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the main street of the pleasant village of Delafield Savory Gray,
      Esq., hired a large house, with an avenue of young lindens in front, a
      garden on one side, and a spacious play-ground in the rear. The pretty
      pond was not far away, with its sloping shores and neat villas, and a
      distant spire upon the opposite bank&mdash;the whole like the vignette of
      an English pastoral poem. Here the merchant turned from importing pongees
      to inculcating principles. His old friends sent some of their children to
      the new school, and persuaded their friends to send others. Some of his
      former correspondents in other parts of the world, not entirely satisfied
      with the Asian and East Indian systems of education, shipped their sons to
      Mr. Gray. The good man was glad to see them. He was not very learned, and
      therefore could not communicate knowledge. But he did his best, and tried
      very hard to be respected. The boys did not learn any thing; but they had
      plenty of good beef, and Mr. Gray played practical jokes upon them; and on
      Sundays they all went to hear Dr. Peewee preach.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; HOPE WAYNE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When there was a report that Mr. Savory Gray was coming to Delafield to
      establish a school for boys, Dr. Peewee, the minister of the village,
      called to communicate the news to Mr. Christopher Burt, his oldest and
      richest parishioner, at Pine wood, his country seat. When Mr. Burt heard
      the news, he foresaw trouble without end; for his orphan grand-daughter,
      Hope Wayne, who lived with him, was nearly eighteen years old; and it had
      been his fixed resolution that she should be protected from the wicked
      world of youth that is always going up and down in the earth seeking whom
      it may marry. If incessant care, and invention, and management could
      secure it, she should arrive safely where Grandpa Burt was determined she
      should arrive ultimately, at the head of her husband&rsquo;s dinner-table,
      Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe was Mr. Burt&rsquo;s housekeeper. So far as any body could
      say, Mrs. Burt died at a period of which the memory of man runneth not to
      the contrary. There were traditions of other housekeepers. But since the
      death of Hope&rsquo;s mother Mrs. Simcoe was the only incumbent. She had
      been Mrs. Wayne&rsquo;s nurse in her last moments, and had rocked the
      little Hope to sleep the night after her mother&rsquo;s burial. She was
      always tidy, erect, imperturbable. She pervaded the house; and her eye was
      upon a table-cloth, a pane of glass, or a carpet, almost as soon as the
      spot which arrested it. Housekeeper <i>nascitur non fit</i>. She was so
      silent and shadowy that the whole house sympathized with her, until it
      became extremely uncomfortable to the servants, who constantly went away;
      and a story that the house was haunted became immensely popular and
      credible the moment it was told.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no visiting at Pinewood for a long time, because of the
      want of a mistress and of the unsocial habits of Mr. Burt. But the
      neighboring ladies were just beginning to call upon Miss Wayne. When she
      returned the visits Mrs. Simcoe accompanied her in the carriage, and sat
      there while Miss Wayne performed the parlor ceremony. Then they drove
      home. Mr. Burt dined at two, and Miss Hope sat opposite her grandfather at
      table; Hiram waited. Mrs. Simcoe dined alone in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, too, she sat alone in the long summer afternoons, when the work of
      the house was over for the day. She held a book by the open window, or
      gazed for a very long time out upon the landscape. There were pine-trees
      near her window; but beyond she could see green meadows, and blue hills,
      and a glittering river, and rounded reaches of woods. She watched the
      clouds, or, at least, looked at the sky. She heard the birds in spring
      days, and the dry hot locusts on sultry afternoons; and she looked with
      the same unchanging eyes upon the opening buds and blooming flowers, as
      upon the worms that swung themselves on filaments and ate the leaves and
      ruined the trees, or the autumnal hectic which Death painted upon the
      leaves that escaped the worms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes on these still, warm afternoons her lips parted, as if she were
      singing. But it was a very grave, quiet performance. There was none of the
      gush and warmth of song, although the words she uttered were always those
      of the hymns of Charles Wesley&mdash;those passionate, religious songs of
      the New Jerusalem. For Mrs. Simcoe was a Methodist, and with Methodist
      hymns she had sung Hope to sleep in the days when she was a baby; so that
      the young woman often listened to the music in church with a heart full of
      vague feelings, and dim, inexplicable memories, not knowing that she was
      hearing, though with different words, the strains that her nurse had
      whispered over her crib in the hymns of Wesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be presumed that at some period Mrs. Simcoe, whom Mr. Burt always
      addressed in the same manner as &ldquo;Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
      had received a general system of instruction to the effect that &ldquo;My
      grand-daughter, Miss Wayne&mdash;Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;will marry
      a gentleman of wealth and position; and I expect her to be fitted to
      preside over his household. Yes, Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What on earth is a girl sent into this world for but to make a proper
      match, and not disgrace her husband&mdash;to keep his house, either
      directly or by a deputy&mdash;to take care of his children, to see that
      his slippers are warm and his Madeira cold, and his beef not burned to a
      cinder, Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am? Christopher Burt believed that a man&rsquo;s
      wife was a more sacred piece of private property than his sheep-pasture,
      and when he delivered the deed of any such property he meant that it
      should be in perfect order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope may marry a foreign minister, Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am. Who
      knows? She may marry a large merchant in town or a large planter at the
      South, who will be obliged to entertain a great deal, and from all parts
      of the world. I intend that she shall be fit for the situation, that she
      shall preside at her husband&rsquo;s table in a superior manner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hope, as a child, had played with little girls, who were invited to
      Pinewood&mdash;select little girls, who came in the prettiest frocks and
      behaved in the prettiest way, superintended by nurses and ladies&rsquo;
      maids. They tended their dolls peaceably in the nursery; they played clean
      little games upon the lawn. Not too noisy, Ellen! Mary, gently, gently,
      dear! Julia, carefully! you are tumbling your frock. They were not
      chattery French nurses who presided over these solemnities; they were
      grave, housekeeping, Mrs. Simcoe-kind of people. Julia and Mary were
      exhorted to behave themselves like little ladies, and the frolic ended by
      their all taking books from the library shelves and sitting properly in a
      large chair, or on the sofa, or even upon the piazza, if it had been
      nicely dusted and inspected, until the setting sun sent them away with the
      calmest kisses at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hope grew older she had teachers at home&mdash;recluse old scholars,
      decayed clergymen in shiny black coats, who taught her Latin, and looked
      at her through round spectacles, and, as they looked, remembered that they
      were once young. She had teachers of history, of grammar, of arithmetic&mdash;of
      all English studies. Some of these Mentors were weak-eyed fathers of ten
      children, who spoke so softly that their wives must have had loud voices.
      Others were young college graduates, with low collars and long hair, who
      read with Miss Wayne in English literature, while Mrs. Simcoe sat knitting
      in the next chair. Then there had been the Italian music-masters, and the
      French teachers, very devoted, never missing a lesson, but also never
      missing Mrs. Simcoe, who presided over all instruction which was imparted
      by any Mentor under sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Hope grew older still and found Byron upon the shelves of the
      Library, his romantic sadness responded to the vague longing of her heart.
      Instinctively she avoided all that repels a woman in his verses, as she
      would have avoided the unsound parts of a fruit. But the solitary,
      secluded girl lived unconsciously and inevitably in a dream world, for she
      had no knowledge of any other, nor contact with it. Proud and shy, her
      heart was restless, her imagination morbid, and she believed in heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Peewee had told Mr. Burt all that he knew about the project of
      the school, Mr. Burt rang the bell violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Miss Hope to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant disappeared, and in a few moments Hope Wayne entered the room.
      To Dr. Peewee&rsquo;s eyes she seemed wrapped only in a cloud of delicate
      muslin, and the wind had evidently been playing with her golden hair, for
      she had been lying upon the lawn reading Byron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want me, grandfather?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear. Mr. Gray, a respectable person, is coming here to set
      up a school. There will be a great many young men and boys. I shall never
      ask them to the house. I hate boys. I expect you to hate them too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, my dear,&rdquo; said Dr. Peewee; &ldquo;hate the
      boys? Yes; we must hate the boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne looked at the two old gentlemen, and answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need have warned me, grandfather; I&rsquo;m
      not so apt to fall in love with boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Hope; I know. Ever since you have lived with me&mdash;how
      long is it, my dear, since your mother died?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, grandfather; I never saw her,&rdquo; replied
      Hope, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; well, ever since then you have been a good, quiet little
      girl with grandpapa. Here, Cossy, come and give grandpa a kiss. And mind
      the boys! No speaking, no looking&mdash;we are never to know them. You
      understand? Now go, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she closed the door, Dr. Peewee also rose to take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Mr. Burt, as the other pushed back his chair,
      &ldquo;it is a very warm day. Let me advise you to guard against any
      sudden debility or effect of the heat by a little cordial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he led the way into the dining-room, and fumbled slowly over a
      bunch of keys which he drew from his pocket. Finding the proper key, he
      put it into the door of the side-board. &ldquo;In this side-board, Dr.
      Peewee, I keep a bottle of old Jamaica, which was sent me by a former
      correspondent in the West Indies.&rdquo; As Dr. Peewee had heard the same
      remark at least fifty times before, the kindly glistening of his nose must
      be attributed to some other cause than excitement at this intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to preserve my friendly relations with my old commercial
      friends,&rdquo; continued Mr. Burt, speaking very pompously, and slowly
      pouring from a half-empty decanter into a tumbler. &ldquo;I rarely drink
      any thing myself&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, ha!&rdquo; grunted the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;except a glass of port at dinner. Yet, not to be impolite,
      Doctor, not to be impolite, I could not refuse to drink to your very good
      health and safe return to the bosom of your family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Burt drained the glass, quite unobservant of the fact that the
      Rev. Dr. Peewee was standing beside him without glass or old Jamaica. In
      truth Mr. Burt had previously been alarmed about the effect of the bottle
      of port&mdash;which he metaphorically called a glass&mdash;that he had
      drunk at dinner, and to guard against evil results he had already, that
      very afternoon, as he was accustomed to say with an excellent humor, been
      to the West Indies for his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, Doctor, you haven&rsquo;t filled your glass! Permit
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old gentleman poured into the one glass and then into the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Sir,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;now, Sir, let us drink to the
      health of Mr. Gray, but not of the boys&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not of the boys? No, not of the boys. Thank you, Sir&mdash;thank
      you. That is a pleasant liquor, Mr. Burt. H&rsquo;m, ha! a very pleasant
      liquor. Good-afternoon, Mr. Burt; a very good day, Sir. H&rsquo;m, ha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hope left her grandfather, Mrs. Simcoe was sitting at her window, which
      looked over the lawn in front of the house upon which Hope presently
      appeared. It was already toward sunset, and the tender golden light
      streamed upon the landscape like a visible benediction. A few rosy clouds
      lay in long, tranquil lines across the west, and the great trees bathed in
      the sweet air with conscious pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hope stood with folded hands looking toward the sunset, she began
      unconsciously to repeat some of the lines that always lay in her mind like
      invisible writing, waiting only for the warmth of a strong emotion to
      bring them legibly out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
  And its fragments are sunk in the wave;
Though I feel that my soul is delivered
  To pain, it shall not be its slave.
There is many a pang to pursue me;
  They may crush, but they shall not contemn;
They may torture, but shall not subdue me;
  &lsquo;Tis of thee that I think, not of them.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the same moment Mrs. Simcoe was closing her window high over Hope&rsquo;s
      head. Her face was turned toward the sunset with the usual calm impassive
      look, and as she gazed at the darkening landscape she was singing, in her
      murmuring way,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;I rest upon thy word;
  Thy promise is for me:
My succor and salvation, Lord,
  Shall surely come from thee.
But let me still abide,
  Nor from my hope remove,
Till thou my patient spirit guide
  Into thy perfect love.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. &mdash; AVE MARIA!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys sat in several pews, which he could command with his
      eye from his own seat in the broad aisle. Every Sunday morning at the
      first stroke of the bell the boys began to stroll toward the church. But
      after they were seated, and the congregation had assembled, and Dr. Peewee
      had gone up into the pulpit, the wheels of a carriage were heard outside&mdash;steps
      were let down&mdash;there was an opening of doors, a slight scuffing and
      treading, and old Christopher Burt entered. His head was powdered, and he
      wore a queue. His coat collar was slightly whitened with-powder, and he
      carried a gold-headed cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys looked in admiration upon so much respectability, powder, age,
      and gold cane united in one person.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the boys were in love with the golden-haired grand-daughter. They
      went home to talk about her. They went to bed to dream of her. They read
      Mary Lamb&rsquo;s stories from Shakespeare, and Hope Wayne was Ophelia,
      and Desdemona, and Imogen&mdash;above all others, she was Juliet. They
      read the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; and she was all the Arabian
      Princesses with unpronounceable names. They read Miss Edgeworth&mdash;&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Belinda.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, thunder!&rdquo; they cried, and
      dropped the book to think of Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne was not unconscious of the adoration she excited. If a swarm of
      school-boys can not enter a country church without turning all their eyes
      toward one pew, is it not possible that, when a girl comes in and seats
      herself in that pew, the very focus of those burning glances, even Dr.
      Peewee may not entirely distract her mind, however he may rivet her eyes?
      As she takes her last glance at the Sunday toilet in her sunny
      dressing-room at home, and half turns to be sure that the collar is
      smooth, and that the golden curl nestles precisely as it should under the
      moss rose-bud that blushes modestly by the side of a lovelier bloom&mdash;is
      it not just supposable that she thinks, for a wayward instant, of other
      eyes that will presently scan that figure and face, and feels, with a
      half-flush, that they will not be shocked nor disappointed?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a boy in Mr. Gray&rsquo;s school who would have dared to
      dream that Hope Wayne ever had such a thought. When she appeared behind
      Grandfather Burt and the gold-headed cane she had no more antecedents in
      their imaginations than a rose or a rainbow. They no more thought of
      little human weaknesses and mundane influences in regard to her than they
      thought of cold vapor when they looked at sunset clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the service Hope sat stately in the pew, with her eyes fixed upon
      Dr. Peewee. She knew the boys were there. From time to time she observed
      that new boys had arrived, and that older ones had left. But how she
      discovered it, who could say? There was never one of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys
      who could honestly declare that he had seen Hope Wayne looking at either
      of the pews in which they sat. Perhaps she did not hear what Dr. Peewee
      said, although she looked at him so steadily. Perhaps her heart did not
      look out of her eyes, but was busy with a hundred sweet fancies in which
      some one of those fascinated boys had a larger share than he knew.
      Perhaps, when she covered her eyes in an attitude of devotion, she did not
      thereby exclude all thoughts of the outer and lower world. Perhaps the
      Being for whose worship they were assembled was no more displeased with
      the innocent reveries and fancies which floated through that young heart
      than with the soft air and sweet song of birds that played through the
      open windows of the church on some warm June Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the shrill-voiced leader of the choir sounded the key-note of the
      hymn-tune through his nose, and the growling bass-viol joined in unison,
      while the congregation rose, and Dr. Peewee surveyed his people to mark
      who had staid away from service, then Hope Wayne looked at the choir as if
      her whole soul were singing; and young Gabriel Bennet, younger than Hope,
      had a choking feeling as he gazed at her&mdash;an involuntary sense of
      unworthiness and shame before such purity and grace. He counted every line
      of the hymn grudgingly, and loved the tunes that went back and repeated
      and prolonged&mdash;the tunes endlessly <i>da capo</i>&mdash;and the hymns
      that he heard as he looked at her he never forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other eyes than Gabriel Bennet&rsquo;s that watched Hope
      Wayne, and for many months had watched her&mdash;the flashing black eyes
      of Abel Newt. Handsome, strong, graceful, he was one of the oldest boys,
      and a leader at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s school. Like every handsome, bold boy or
      young man, for he was fully eighteen, and seemed much older, Abel Newt had
      plenty of allies at school&mdash;they could hardly be called friends.
      There was many a boy who thought with the one nicknamed Little Malacca,
      although, more prudently than he, he might not say it: &ldquo;Abe gives me
      gingerbread; but I guess I don&rsquo;t like him!&rdquo; If a boy
      interfered with Abe he was always punished. The laugh was turned on him;
      there was ceaseless ridicule and taunting. Then if it grew insupportable,
      and came to fighting, Abel Newt was strong in muscle and furious in wrath,
      and the recusant was generally pommeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reposing upon his easy, conscious superiority, Abel had long worshiped
      Hope Wayne. They were nearly of the same age&mdash;she a few months the
      younger. But as the regulations of the school confined every boy, without
      especial permission of absence, to the school grounds, and as Abel had no
      acquaintance with Mr. Burt and no excuse for calling, his worship had been
      silent and distant. He was the more satisfied that it should be so,
      because it had never occurred to him that any of the other boys could be a
      serious rival for her regard. He was also obliged to be the more satisfied
      with his silent devotion, because never, by a glance, did she betray any
      consciousness of his particular observation, or afford him the least
      opportunity for saying or doing any thing that would betray it. If he
      hastened to the front door of the church he could only stand upon the
      steps, and as she passed out she nodded to her few friends, and
      immediately followed her grandfather into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gabriel Bennet came to Mr. Gray&rsquo;s, Abel did not like him. He
      laughed at him. He made the other boys laugh at him whenever he could. He
      bullied him in the play-ground. He proposed to introduce fagging at Mr.
      Gray&rsquo;s. He praised it as a splendid institution of the British
      schools, simply because he wanted Gabriel as his fag. He wanted to fling
      his boots at Gabriel&rsquo;s head that he might black them. He wanted to
      send him down stairs in his shirt on winter nights. He wanted to have
      Gabriel get up in the cold mornings and bring him his breakfast in bed. He
      wanted to chain Gabriel to the car of his triumphal progress through
      school-life. He wanted to debase and degrade him altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; Abel exclaimed one day to the large boys
      assembled in solemn conclave in the school-room, &ldquo;that takes all the
      boorishness and brutishness out of the English character? What is it that
      prevents the Britishers from being servile and obsequious&mdash;traits, I
      tell you, boys, unknown in England&mdash;but this splendid system of
      fagging? Did you ever hear of an insolent Englishman, a despotic
      Englishman, a surly Englishman, a selfish Englishman, an obstinate
      Englishman, a domineering Englishman, a dogmatic Englishman? Never, boys,
      never. These things are all taken out of them by fagging. It stands to
      reason they should be. If I shy my boots at a fellow&rsquo;s head, is he
      likely to domineer? If I kick a small boy who contradicts me, is he likely
      to be opinionated and dogmatic? If I eat up my fag&rsquo;s plum-cake just
      sent by his mamma, hot, as it were, from the maternal heart, and moist
      with a mother&rsquo;s tears, is that fag likely to be selfish? Not at all.
      The boots, and the kicking, and the general walloping make him manly. It
      teaches him to govern his temper and hold his tongue. I swear I should
      like to have a fag!&rdquo; perorated Abel, meaning that he should like to
      be the holy office, and to have Gabriel Bennet immediately delivered up to
      him for discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Gabriel overheard this kind of conversation in the play-ground, as
      Abel Newt and some of the other boys were resting after a game at ball.
      There were no personal allusions in what Abel had said, but Gabriel took
      him up a little curtly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Abel, how would you like to have Gyles Blanding shy his boots
      at your head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked at him a moment, sarcastically. Then he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend, I should like to see him try it. But fagging
      concerns small boys, not large ones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; retorted Gabriel, his eyes flashing, as he kept tossing
      the ball nervously, and catching it; &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s the meanness
      of it: the little boy can&rsquo;t help himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By golly, I&rsquo;d kick!&rdquo; put in Little Malacca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d be licked till you dropped, my small Sir,&rdquo;
      said Abel, sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Abel,&rdquo; replied Gabriel, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a mean
      thing for an American boy to want fagging.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;there are some young
      American gentlemen I know who would be greatly benefited by being well
      fagged; yes, made to lie down in the dirt and lick a little of it, and
      fetch and carry. And to be kicked out of bed every morning and into bed
      every night would be the very best thing that could happen to &lsquo;em.
      By George, I should like to have the kicking and licking begin now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel had the same dislike of Abel which the latter felt for him, but
      they had never had any open quarrel. Even thus far in the present
      conversation there had been nothing personal said. It was only a warm
      general discussion. Gabriel merely asked, when the other stopped,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good does the fagging do the fellow that flings the boots and
      bullies the little one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good?&rdquo; answered Abel&mdash;&ldquo;what good does it do? Why,
      he has been through it all himself, and he&rsquo;s just paying it off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel smiled grimly as he looked round upon the boys, who did not seem at
      all enthusiastic for his suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have to
      postpone my millennium of fagging. But I don&rsquo;t know what else will
      make men of you. And mark you, my merry men, there&rsquo;s more than one
      kind of fagging;&rdquo; and he looked in a droll way&mdash;a droll way
      that was not in the least funny, but made the boys all wonder what Abel
      Newt was up to now.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; NIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was already dusk, but the summer evening is the best time for play. The
      sport in the play-ground at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s was at its height, and the
      hot, eager, panting boys were shouting and scampering in every direction,
      when a man ran in from the road and cried out, breathless,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Gray?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his study,&rdquo; answered twenty voices at once. The man darted
      toward the house and went in; the next moment he reappeared with Mr. Gray,
      both of them running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out the boat!&rdquo; cried Mr. Gray, &ldquo;and call the big
      boys. There&rsquo;s a man drowning in the pond!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The game was over at once, and each young heart thrilled with vague
      horror. Abel Newt, Muddock, Blanding, Tom Gait, Jim Greenidge, and the
      rest of the older boys, came rushing out of the school-room, and ran
      toward the barn, in which the boat was kept upon a truck. In a moment the
      door was open, the truck run out, and all the boys took hold of the rope.
      Mr. Gray and the stranger led the way. The throng swept out of the gate,
      and as they hastened silently along, the axles of the truck kindled with
      the friction and began to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carefully! steadily!&rdquo; cried the boys all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slackened speed a little, but, happily, the pond was but a short
      distance from the school. It was a circular sheet of water, perhaps a mile
      in width.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, he is nearly on the other side,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, as the
      crowd reached the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the boat was afloat. Mr. Gray, the stranger, and the six
      stoutest boys in the school, stepped into it. The boys lifted their oars.
      &ldquo;Let fall! give way!&rdquo; cried Mr. Gray, and the boat moved off,
      glimmering away into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger boys remained hushed and awe-stricken upon the shore. The
      stars were just coming out, the wind had fallen, and the smooth, black
      pond lay silent at their feet. They could see the vague, dark outline of
      the opposite shore, but none of the pretty villas that stood in graceful
      groves upon the banks&mdash;none of the little lawns that sloped, with a
      feeling of human sympathy, to the water. The treachery of that glassy
      surface was all they thought of. They shuddered to remember that they had
      so often bathed in the pond, and recoiled as if they had been friends of a
      murderer. None of them spoke. They clustered closely together, listening
      intently. Nothing was audible but the hum of the evening insects and the
      regular muffled beat of the oars over the water. The boys strained their
      ears and held their breath as the sound suddenly stopped. But they
      listened in vain. The lazy tree-toads sang, the monotonous hum of the
      night went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel Bennet held the hand of Little Malacca&mdash;a dark-eyed boy, who
      was supposed in the school to have had no father or mother, and who had
      instinctively attached himself to Gabriel from the moment they met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful?&rdquo; whispered the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gabriel, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dreadful to be young
      when a man&rsquo;s drowning, for you can&rsquo;t do any thing. Hist!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a movement, as they heard a dull, distant sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s Jim Greenidge,&rdquo; whispered Little
      Malacca, under his breath; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the best diver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody answered. The slow minutes passed. Some of the boys peered timidly
      into the dark, and clung closer to their neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they come!&rdquo; said Gabriel suddenly, in a low voice, and
      in a few moments the beat of the oars was heard again. Still nobody spoke.
      Most of the boys were afraid that when the boat appeared they should see a
      dead body, and they dreaded it. Some felt homesick, and began to cry. The
      throb of oars came nearer and nearer. The boat glimmered out of the
      darkness, and almost at the same moment slid up the shore. The solemn
      undertone in which the rowers spoke told all. Death was in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel Bennet could see the rowers step quickly out, and with great care
      run the boat upon the truck. He said, &ldquo;Come, boys!&rdquo; and they
      all moved together and grasped the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; said Mr. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something lay across the seats covered with a large cloak. The boys did
      not look behind, but they all knew what they were dragging. The homely
      funeral-car rolled slowly along under the stars. The crickets chirped; the
      multitudinous voice of the summer night murmured on every side, mingling
      with the hollow rumble of the truck. In a few moments the procession
      turned into the grounds, and the boat was drawn to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little boys may go,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dropped the rope and turned away. They did not even try to see what
      was done with the body; but when Blanding came out of the house afterward,
      they asked him who found the drowned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Greenidge,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He stripped as soon as we
      were well out on the pond, and asked the stranger gentleman to show him
      about where his friend sank. The moment the place was pointed out he dove.
      The first time he found nothing. The second time he touched him&rdquo;&mdash;the
      boys shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;and he actually brought him up to the surface.
      But he was quite dead. Then we took him into the boat and covered him
      over. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no more games, there was no other talk, that evening. When the
      boys were going to bed, Gabriel asked Little Malacca in which room Jim
      Greenidge slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sleeps in Number Seven. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I only wanted to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel Bennet could not sleep. His mind was too busy with the events of
      the day. All night long he could think of nothing but the strong figure of
      Jim Greenidge erect in the summer night, then plunging silently into the
      black water. When it was fairly light he hurried on his clothes, and
      passing quietly along the hall, knocked at the door of Number Seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; cried a voice within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel Bennet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Abel Newt who spoke; and as Gabriel stepped in, Newt asked,
      abruptly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to Jim Greenidge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there he is,&rdquo; replied Newt, pointing to another bed.
      &ldquo;Jim! Jim!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenidge roused himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said his cheery voice, as he rose
      upon his elbow and looked at Gabriel with his kind eyes. &ldquo;Come here,
      Gabriel. What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel hesitated, for Abel Newt was looking sharply at him. But in a
      moment he went to Greenidge&rsquo;s bedside, and said, shyly, in a low
      voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I black your boots for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black my boots! Why, Gabriel, what on earth do you mean? No, of
      course you shall not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the strong youth looked pleasantly on the boy who stood by his
      bedside, and then put out his hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I brush your clothes then, or do any thing for you?&rdquo;
      persisted Gabriel, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Why do you want to?&rdquo; replied Greenidge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I only thought it would be pleasant if I could do something&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all,&rdquo; said Gabriel, as he moved slowly away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
      to have waked you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door gently as he went out. Jim Greenidge lay for some time
      resting upon his elbow, wondering why a boy who had scarcely ever spoken a
      word to him before should suddenly want to be his servant. He could make
      nothing of it, and, tired with the excitement of the previous evening, he
      lay down again for a morning nap.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; PEEWEE PREACHING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon the following Sunday the Rev. Amos Peewee, D.D., made a suitable
      improvement of the melancholy event of the week. He enlarged upon the
      uncertainty of life. He said that in the midst of life we are in death. He
      said that we are shadows and pursue shades. He added that we are here
      to-day and gone to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the long prayer before the sermon a violent thunder-gust swept from
      the west and dashed against the old wooden church. As the Doctor poured
      forth his petitions he made the most extraordinary movements with his
      right hand. He waved it up and down rapidly. He opened his eyes for an
      instant as if to find somebody. He seemed to be closing imaginary windows&mdash;and
      so he was. It leaked out the next day at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s that Dr. Peewee
      was telegraphing the sexton at random&mdash;for he did not know where to
      look for him&mdash;to close the windows. Nobody better understood the
      danger of draughts from windows, during thunder-storms, than the Doctor;
      nobody knew better than he that the lightning-rod upon the spire was no
      protection at all, but that the iron staples with which it was clamped to
      the building would serve, in case of a bolt&rsquo;s striking the church,
      to drive its whole force into the building. As a loud crash burst over the
      village in the midst of his sermon, and showed how frightfully near the
      storm was, his voice broke into a shrill quaver, as he faltered out,
      &ldquo;Yes, my brethren, let us be calm under all circumstances, and Death
      will have no terrors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Amos Peewee had been settled in the village of Delafield since a
      long period before the Revolution, according to the boys. But the parish
      register carried the date only to the beginning of this century. He wore a
      silken gown in summer, and a woolen gown in winter, and black worsted
      gloves, always with the middle finger of the right-hand glove slit, that
      he might more conveniently turn the leaves of the Bible, and the
      hymn-book, and his own sermons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pews of the old meeting-house were high, and many of them square. The
      heads of the people of consideration in the congregation were mostly bald,
      as beseems respectable age, and as the smooth, shiny line of pates
      appeared above the wooden line of the pews they somehow sympathetically
      blended into one gleaming surface of worn wood and skull, until it seemed
      as if the Doctor&rsquo;s theological battles were all fought upon the
      heads of his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Doctor was by no means altogether polemical. After defeating and
      utterly confounding the fathers who fired their last shot a thousand years
      ago, and who had not a word to say against his remaining master of the
      field, he was wont to unbend his mind and recreate his fancy by practical
      discourses. His sermons upon lying were celebrated all through the
      village. He gave the insidious vice no quarter. He charged upon it from
      all sides at once. Lying couldn&rsquo;t stand for a moment. White lies,
      black lies, blue lies, and green lies, lies of ceremony, of charity, and
      of good intention disappeared before the lightning of his wrath. They are
      all children of the Devil, with different complexions, said Dr. Peewee.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if lying be a vice, surely, said he, discretion is a virtue. &ldquo;My
      dear Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said Dr. Peewee to that gentleman when he was about
      establishing his school in the village, and was consulting with the Doctor
      about bringing his boys to church&mdash;&ldquo;my dear Mr. Gray,&rdquo;
      said the Doctor, putting down his cigar and stirring his toddy (he was of
      an earlier day), &ldquo;above all things a clergyman should be discreet.
      In fact, Christianity is discretion. A man must preach at sins, not
      sinners. Where would society be if the sins of individuals were to be
      rudely assaulted?&mdash;one more lump, if you please. A man&rsquo;s sins
      are like his corns. Neither the shoe nor the sermon must fit too snugly. I
      am a clergyman, but I hope I am also a man of common sense&mdash;a
      practical man, Mr. Gray. The general moral law and the means of grace,
      those are the proper themes of the preacher. And the pastor ought to
      understand the individual characters and pursuits of his parishioners,
      that he may avoid all personality in applying the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; reasoned the Doctor, as he slowly stirred his
      toddy, and gesticulated with one skinny forefinger, occasionally sipping
      as he went on, &ldquo;if I have a deacon in my church who is a notorious
      miser, is it not plain that, if I preach a strong sermon upon
      covetousness, every body in the church will think of my deacon&mdash;will,
      in fact, apply the sermon to him? The deacon, of course, will be the first
      to do it. And then, why, good gracious! he might even take his hat and
      cane and stalk heavily down the broad aisle, under my very nose, before my
      very eyes, and slam the church door after him in my very face! Here at
      once is difficulty in the church; hard feeling; perhaps even swearing. Am
      I, as a Christian clergyman, to give occasion to uncharitable emotions,
      even to actual profanity? Is not a Christian congregation, was not every
      early Christian community, a society of brothers? Of course they were; of
      course we must be. Little children, love one another. Let us dwell
      together, my brethren, in amity,&rdquo; said the Doctor, putting down his
      glass, and forgetting that he was in Mr. Gray&rsquo;s study; &ldquo;and
      please give me your ears while I show you this morning the enormity of
      burning widows upon the funeral pyres of their husbands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the Peewee Christianity; and after such a sermon the deacon has
      been known to say to his wife&mdash;thin she was in the face, which had a
      settled shade, like the sober twilight of valleys from which the sun has
      long been gone, though it has not yet set&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shocking people the Hindoos are! They actually burn widows! My
      dear, how grateful we ought to be that we live in a Christian country
      where wives are not burned!&mdash;Abraham! if you put another stick of
      wood into that stove I&rsquo;ll skin you alive, Sir. Go to bed this
      instant, you wicked boy!&mdash;It must be bad enough to be a widow, my
      dear, let alone the burning. Shall we have evening prayers, Mrs. Deacon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of the day on which the Doctor improved the drowning, and
      exhorted his hearers to be brave, Mr. Gray asked Gabriel Bennet, &ldquo;Where
      was the text?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir,&rdquo; replied Gabriel. As he spoke there
      was the sound of warm discussion on the other side of the dining-room, in
      which the boys sat during the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Gyles?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing. We were
      talking about a ribbon, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ribbon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ribbon we saw at church, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whose was it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it was Miss Hope Wayne&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe, Gyles? Why don&rsquo;t you speak out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, the fact is that Abel Newt says she had a purple ribbon
      on her bonnet&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Gabriel, breaking in, impetuously.
      &ldquo;She had a beautiful blue ribbon, and lilies of the valley inside,
      and a white lace vail, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel stopped and turned very red, for he caught Abel Newt&rsquo;s eyes
      fixed sharply upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ho! the text was there, was it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gray, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abel Newt only said, quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well! I guess it <i>was</i> a blue ribbon after all.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; EXPERIMENTUM CRUCIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, Gyles;&rdquo; said Abel to Blanding, his chum,
      &ldquo;Gabriel Bennet&rsquo;s mother ought to come and take him home for
      the summer to play with the other calves in the country. People shouldn&rsquo;t
      leave their spoons about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys went in to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, as the pupils were sitting in the dining-room, as usual,
      some chatting, some reading, others quite ready to go to bed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said Abel to Uncle Savory, who was sitting talking
      with Mrs. Gray, whose hands, which were never idle, were now busily
      knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Abel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we have some game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Boys, what shall we do? Let us see. There&rsquo;s the
      Grand Mufti, and the Elements, and My ship&rsquo;s come loaded with&mdash;and&mdash;well,
      what shall it be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gray, it&rsquo;s a good while since we&rsquo;ve tried all
      calling out together. We haven&rsquo;t done it since Gabriel Bennet came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Mr. Gray, as his small eyes
      twinkled at the prospect of a little fun; &ldquo;no, we haven&rsquo;t.
      Now, boys, of course a good many of you have played the game before. But
      you, new boys, attend! the thing is this. When I say three&mdash;<i>one,
      two, three</i>!&mdash;every body is to shout out the name of his
      sweet-heart. The fun is that nobody hears any thing, because every body
      bawls so loud. You see?&rdquo; asked he, apparently feeling for his
      handkerchief. &ldquo;Gabriel, before we begin, just run into the study and
      get my handkerchief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel, full of expectation of the fun, ran out of the room. The moment
      he closed the door Mr. Gray lifted his finger and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys! every body remain perfectly quiet when I say three.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was needless to explain why, for every body saw the intended joke, and
      Gabriel returned instantly from the study saying that the handkerchief was
      not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray. &ldquo;Are you all ready, boys.
      Now, then&mdash;<i>one, two, three</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the word left Mr. Gray&rsquo;s lips, Gabriel, candid, full of spirit,
      jumped up from his seat with the energy of his effort, and shouted out at
      the top of his voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope Wayne!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;It was cruel. That name alone broke the silence, ringing out in
      enthusiastic music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel&rsquo;s face instantly changed. Still standing erect and dismayed,
      he looked rapidly around the room from boy to boy, and at Mr. Gray. There
      was just a moment of utter silence, and then a loud peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel&rsquo;s color came and went. His heart winced, but not his eye.
      Young hearts are tender, and a joke like this cuts deeply. But just as he
      was about to yield, and drop the tell-tale tear of a sensitive, mortified
      boy, he caught the eye of Abel Newt. It was calmly studying him as a Roman
      surgeon may have watched the gladiator in the arena, while his life-blood
      ebbed away. Gabriel remembered Abel&rsquo;s words in the play-ground&mdash;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      more than one kind of fagging.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the laugh was over, Gabriel&rsquo;s had been loudest of all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; CASTLE DANGEROUS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day when school was dismissed, Abel asked leave to stroll out of
      bounds. He pushed along the road, whistling cheerily, whipping the
      road-side grass and weeds with his little ratan, and all the while
      approaching the foot of the hill up which the road wound through the
      estate of Pinewood. As he turned up the hill he walked more slowly, and
      presently stopped and leaned upon a pair of bars which guarded the
      entrance of one of Mr. Burt&rsquo;s pastures. He gazed for some time down
      into the rich green field that sloped away from the road toward a little
      bowery stream, but still whistled, as if he were looking into his mind
      rather than at the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaning and musing and vaguely whistling, he turned up the hill
      again and continued his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he reached the entrance of Pinewood&mdash;a high iron gate,
      between huge stone posts, on the tops of which were urns overflowing with
      vines, that hung down and partly tapestried the columns. Immediately upon
      entering the grounds the carriage avenue wound away from the gate, so that
      the passer-by could see nothing as he looked through but the hedge which
      skirted and concealed the lawn. The fence upon the road was a high, solid
      stone wall, along whose top clustered a dense shrubbery, so that, although
      the land rose from the road toward the house, the lawn was entirely
      sequestered; and you might sit upon it and enjoy the pleasant rural
      prospect of fields, woods, and hills, without being seen from the road.
      The house itself was a stately, formal mansion. Its light color contrasted
      well with the lofty pine-trees around it. But they, in turn, invested it
      with an air of secrecy and gloom, unrelieved by flowers or blossoming
      shrubs, of which there were no traces near the house, although in the rear
      there was a garden so formally regular that it looked like a penitentiary
      for flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the pine-trees that Hope Wayne had heard sing all her life&mdash;but
      sing like the ocean, not like birds or human voices. In the black autumn
      midnights they struggled with the north winds that smote them fiercely and
      filled the night with uproar, while the child cowering in her bed thought
      of wrecks on pitiless shores&mdash;of drowning mothers and hapless
      children. Through the summer nights they sighed. But it was not a lullaby&mdash;it
      was not a serenade. It was the croning of a Norland enchantress, and young
      Hope sat at her open window, looking out into the moonlight, and
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt opened the gate and passed in. He walked along the avenue, from
      which the lawn was still hidden by the skirting hedge, went up the steps,
      and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Burt at home?&rdquo; he asked, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, Sir,&rdquo; said the nimble Hiram, going before, but half
      turning and studying the visitor as he spoke, and quite unable to
      comprehend him at a glance. &ldquo;I will speak to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt was shown into a large drawing-room. The furniture was draped
      for the season in cool-colored chintz. There was a straw matting upon the
      floor. The chandeliers and candelabras were covered with muslin, and heavy
      muslin curtains hung over the windows. The tables and chairs were of a
      clumsy old-fashioned pattern, with feet in the form of claws clasping
      balls, and a generally stiff, stately, and uncomfortable air. The
      fire-place was covered by a heavy painted fire-board. The polished brass
      andirons, which seemed to feel the whole weight of responsibility in
      supporting the family dignity, stood across the hearth, belligerently
      bright, and there were sprays of asparagus in a china vase in front of
      them. A few pictures hung upon the wall&mdash;family portraits, Abel
      thought; at least old Christopher was there, painted at the age of ten,
      standing, in very clean attire, holding a book in one hand and a hoop in
      the other. The picture was amusing, and looked to Abel symbolical,
      representing the model boy, equally devoted to study and play. That
      singular sneering smile flitted over his face as he muttered, &ldquo;The
      Reverend Gabriel Bennet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few books upon the centre-table, carefully placed and
      balanced as if they had been porcelain ornaments. The bindings and the
      edges of the leaves had a fresh, unworn look. The outer window-blinds were
      closed, and the whole room had a chilly formality and dimness which was
      not hospitable nor by any means inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel seated himself in an easy-chair, and was still smiling at the
      portrait of Master Christopher Burt at the age of ten, when that
      gentleman, at the age of seventy-three, was heard in the hall. Hiram had
      left the door open, so that Abel had full notice of his approach, and rose
      just before the old gentleman entered, and stood with his cap in his hand
      and his head slightly bent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Burt came into the room, and said, a little fiercely, as he saw the
      visitor,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir!&rdquo; he repeated, more blandly, apparently mollified
      by something in the appearance of the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burt,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;I am sure you will excuse me
      when you understand the object of my call; although I am fully aware of
      the liberty I am taking in intruding upon your valuable time and the many
      important cares which must occupy the attention of a gentleman so
      universally known, honored, and loved in the community as you are, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come here to compliment me, Sir?&rdquo; asked Mr. Burt.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some kind of subscription paper, I suppose.&rdquo;
      The old gentleman began to warm up as he thought of it. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t
      give any thing. I never do&mdash;I never will. It&rsquo;s an infernal
      swindle. Some deuced Missionary Society, or Tract Society, or Bible
      Society, some damnable doing-good society, that bleeds the entire
      community, has sent you up here, Sir, to suck money out of me with your
      smooth face. They&rsquo;re always at it. They&rsquo;re always sending
      boys, and ministers in the milk, by Jove! and women that talk in a way to
      turn the milk sour in the cellar, Sir, and who have already turned
      themselves sour in the face, Sir, and whom a man can&rsquo;t turn out of
      doors, Sir, to swindle money out of innocent people! I tell you, young
      man, &lsquo;twon&rsquo;t work! I&rsquo;ll, be whipped if I give you a
      solitary red cent!&rdquo; And Christopher Burt, in a fine wrath, seated
      himself by the table, and wiped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel stood patiently and meekly under this gust of fury, and when it was
      ended, and Mr. Burt was a little composed, he began quietly, as if the
      indignation were the most natural thing in the world:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir; it is not a subscription paper&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a subscription paper!&rdquo; interrupted the old gentleman,
      lifting his head and staring at him. &ldquo;Why, what the deuce is it,
      then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir, as I was just saying,&rdquo; calmly returned Abel,
      &ldquo;it is a personal matter altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! eh! what?&rdquo; cried Mr. Burt, on the edge of another
      paroxysm, &ldquo;what the deuce does that mean? Who are you. Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am one of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys, Sir,&rdquo; replied Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! what!&rdquo; thundered Grandpa Burt, springing up suddenly,
      his mind opening upon a fresh scent. &ldquo;One of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys?
      How dare you, Sir, come into my house? Who sent you here, Sir? What right
      have you to intrude into this place, Sir? Hiram! Hiram!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; answered the man, as he came across the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show this young man out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have some message, Sir,&rdquo; said Hiram, who had heard the
      preceding conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got any message?&rdquo; asked Mr. Burt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir; but I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burt,&rdquo; said Abel, with placid persistence, &ldquo;being
      one of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys, I go of course to Dr. Peewee&rsquo;s Church,
      and there I have so often seen&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Sir, this is a little too much. Hiram, put this boy
      out,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, quite beside himself as he thought of
      his grand-daughter. &ldquo;Seen, indeed! What business have you to see,
      Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So often seen your venerable figure,&rdquo; resumed Abel in the
      same tone as before, while Mr. Burt turned suddenly and looked at him
      closely, &ldquo;that I naturally asked who you were. I was told, Sir; and
      hearing of your wealth and old family, and so on, Sir, I was interested&mdash;it
      was only natural, Sir&mdash;in all that belongs to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! eh! what?&rdquo; said Mr. Burt, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly, Mr. Burt, in your&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! young man, you&rsquo;d better go if you don&rsquo;t want
      to have your head broken. D&rsquo;ye come here to beard me in my own
      house? By George! your impudence stupefies me, Sir. I tell you go this
      minute!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abel continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your beautiful&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to say it, Sir!&rdquo; cried the old man, shaking
      his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place,&rdquo; said Abel, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman glared at him with a look of mixed surprise and
      suspicion. But the boy wore the same look of candor. He held his cap in
      his hand. His black hair fell around his handsome face. He was entirely
      calm, and behaved in the most respectful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Sir?&rdquo; said Christopher Burt, in great
      perplexity, as he seated himself again, and drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply, Sir, that I am very fond of sketching. My teacher says I
      draw very well, and I have had a great desire to draw your place, but I
      did not dare to ask permission. It is said in school, Sir, that you don&rsquo;t
      like Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys, and I knew nobody who could introduce me. But
      to-day, as I came by, every thing looked so beautifully, and I was so sure
      that I could make a pretty picture if I could only get leave to come
      inside the grounds, that almost unconsciously I found myself coming up the
      avenue and ringing the bell. That&rsquo;s all, Sir; and I&rsquo;m sure I
      beg your pardon for troubling you so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burt listened to this speech with a pacified air. He was perhaps a
      little ashamed of his furious onslaughts and interruptions, and therefore
      the more graciously inclined toward the request of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the old man said, with tolerable grace,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, I am willing you should draw my house. Will you do it
      this afternoon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Sir,&rdquo; replied Abel, &ldquo;I had no intention of
      asking you to-day; and as I strolled out merely for a walk, I did not
      bring my drawing materials with me. But if you would allow me to come at
      any time, Sir, I should be very deeply obliged. I am devoted to my art,
      Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you mean to be an artist?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phit! phit! Don&rsquo;t do any such silly thing, Sir. An artist!
      Why how much does an artist make in a year?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, the money I don&rsquo;t know about, but the fame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the fame! The fiddle, Sir! You are capable of better things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance, Mr. Burt&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trade, Sir, trade&mdash;trade. That is the way to fortune in this
      country. Enterprise, activity, shrewdness, industry, that&rsquo;s what a
      young man wants. Get rid of your fol-de-rol notions about art. Benjamin
      West was a great man, Sir; but he was an exception, and besides he lived
      in England. I respect Benjamin West, Sir, of course. We all do. He made a
      good thing of it. Take the word of an old man who has seen life and knows
      the world, and remember that, with all your fine fiddling, it is money
      makes the mare go. Old men like me don&rsquo;t mince matters, Sir. It&rsquo;s
      money&mdash;money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel thought old men sometimes minced grammar a little, but he did not say
      so. He only looked respectful, and said, &ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About drawing the house, come when you choose,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Burt, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may take more than one, or even three or four afternoons, Sir,
      to do it properly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well. If I&rsquo;m not at home ask for Mrs. Simcoe, d&rsquo;ye
      hear? Mrs. Simcoe. She will attend to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel bowed very respectfully and as if he were controlling a strong desire
      to kneel and kiss the foot of his Holiness, Christopher Burt; but he
      mastered himself, and Hiram opened the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Hiram,&rdquo; said. Abel, putting a piece of money into
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Sir,&rdquo; said Hiram, pocketing the coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel walked sedately down the steps, and looked carefully around him. He
      scanned the windows; he glanced under the trees; but he saw nothing. He
      did every thing, in fact, but study the house which he had been asking
      permission to draw. He looked as if for something or somebody who did not
      appear. But as Hiram still stood watching him, he moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked faster as he approached the gate. He opened it; flung it to
      behind him, broke into a little trot, and almost tumbled over Gabriel
      Bennet and Little Malacca as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collision was rude, and the three boys stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better look where you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; said
      Gabriel, sharply, his cheeks reddening and swelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel&rsquo;s first impulse was to strike; but he restrained himself, and
      in the most contemptuous way said merely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the Reverend Gabriel Bennet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely spoken when Gabriel fell upon him like a young lion. So
      sudden and impetuous was his attack that for a moment Abel was confounded.
      He gave way a little, and was well battered almost before he could strike
      in return. Then his strong arms began to tell. He was confident of
      victory, and calmer than his antagonist; but it was like fighting a flame,
      so fierce and rapid were Gabriel&rsquo;s strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Malacca looked on in amazement and terror. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
      cried he, as he saw the faces of the fighters. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!
      Abel, you&rsquo;ll kill him!&rdquo; For Abel was now fully aroused. He was
      seriously hurt by Gabriel&rsquo;s blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! there&rsquo;s somebody coming!&rdquo; cried Little
      Malacca, with the tears in his eyes, as the sound of a carriage was heard
      driving down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combatants said nothing. The faces of both of them were bruised, and
      the blood was flowing. Gabriel was clearly flagging; and Abel&rsquo;s face
      was furious as he struck his heavy blows, under which the smaller boy
      staggered, but did not yet succumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please! please!&rdquo; cried Little Malacca, imploringly, the
      tears streaming down his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Abel Newt drew back, aimed a tremendous blow at Gabriel,
      and delivered it with fearful force upon his head. The smaller boy
      staggered, reeled, threw up his arms, and fell heavily forward into the
      road, senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve killed him! You&rsquo;ve killed him!&rdquo; sobbed
      Little Malacca, piteously, kneeling down and bending over Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt stood bareheaded, frowning under his heavy hair, his hands
      clenched, his face bruised and bleeding, his mouth sternly set as he
      looked down upon his opponent. Suddenly he heard a sound close by him&mdash;a
      half-smothered cry. He looked up. It was the Burt carriage, and Hope Wayne
      was gazing in terror from the window.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; AFTER THE BATTLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hiram was summoned to the door by a violent ringing of the bell. Visions
      of apoplexy&mdash;of&mdash;in fact, of any thing that might befall a testy
      gentleman of seventy-three, inclined to make incessant trips to the West
      Indies&mdash;rushed to his mind as he rushed to the door. He opened it in
      hot haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood Hope Wayne, pale, her eyes flashing, her hand ungloved. At the
      foot of the steps was the carriage, and in the carriage sat Mrs. Simcoe,
      with a bleeding boy&rsquo;s head resting upon her shoulder. The coachman
      stood at the carriage door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Hiram, help James to bring in this poor boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; replied the man, as he ran down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, and the coachman and Hiram lifted out Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried him, still unconscious, up stairs and laid him on a couch.
      Old Burt could not refuse an act of mere humanity, but he said in a loud
      voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a conspiracy to get into the house, Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am.
      I&rsquo;ll have bull-dogs&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have blunderbusses and
      spring-guns, Mrs. Simcoe, ma&rsquo;am! And what do you mean by fighting at
      my gate, Sir?&rdquo; he said, turning upon Little Malacca, who quivered
      under his wrath. &ldquo;What are you doing at my gate? Can&rsquo;t Mr.
      Gray keep his boys at home? Hope, go up stairs!&rdquo; said the old
      gentleman, as he reached the foot of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hope Wayne and Mrs. Simcoe remained with the patient. Hope rubbed the
      boy&rsquo;s hands, and put her own hand upon his forehead from time to
      time, until he sighed heavily and opened his eyes. But before he could
      recognize her she went out to send Hiram to him, while Mrs. Simcoe sat
      quietly by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must put you to bed,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;and
      to-morrow you may go. But why do you fight?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel turned toward her with a piteous look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Simcoe. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk. You
      shall tell all about it some other time. Come in, Hiram,&rdquo; she added,
      as she heard a knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man entered, and Mrs. Simcoe left the room after having told him to
      undress the boy carefully and bathe his face and hands. Gabriel was
      perfectly passive, Hiram was silent, quick, and careful, and in a few
      moments he closed the door softly behind him, and left Gabriel alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now entirely conscious, but very weak. His face was turned toward
      the window, which was open, and he watched the pine-trees that rustled
      gently in the afternoon breeze. It was profoundly still out of doors and
      in the house; and as he lay exhausted, the events of the last few days and
      months swam through his mind in misty confusion. Half-dozing,
      half-sleeping, every thing glimmered before him, and the still hours stole
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his eyes again it was twilight, and he was lying on his
      back looking up at the heavy tester of the great bedstead from which hung
      the curtains, so that he had only glimpses into the chamber. It was large
      and lofty, and the paper on the wall told the story of Telemachus. His
      eyes wandered over it dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could dimly see the beautiful Calypso&mdash;the sage Mentor&mdash;the
      eager pupil&mdash;pallid phantoms floating around him. He seemed to hear
      the beating of the sea upon the shore. The tears came to his eyes. The
      ghostly Calypso put aside the curtain of the bed. Gabriel stretched out
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he murmured, as if he too were a phantom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lips of Calypso moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel was awake in a moment. It was Hope Wayne who spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening she knocked again gently at Gabriel&rsquo;s
      door. There was no reply. She opened the door softly and went in. A
      night-lamp was burning, and threw a pleasant light through the room. The
      windows were open, and the night-air sighed among the pine-trees near
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel&rsquo;s face was turned toward the door, so that Hope saw it as
      she entered. He was sleeping peacefully. At that very moment he was
      dreaming of her. In dreams Hope Wayne was walking with him by the sea, her
      hand in his: her heart his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood motionless lest she might wake him. He did not stir, and she
      heard his low, regular breathing, and knew that all was well. Then she
      turned as noiselessly as she had entered, and went out, leaving him to
      peaceful sleep&mdash;to dreams&mdash;to the sighing of the pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne went quietly to her room, which was next to the one in which
      Gabriel lay. Her kind heart had sent her to see that he wanted nothing.
      She thought of him only as a boy who had had the worst of a quarrel, and
      she pitied him. Was it then, indeed, only pity for the victim that knocked
      gently at his door? Was she really thinking of the conqueror when she went
      to comfort the conquered? Was she not trying somehow to help Abel by doing
      all she could to alleviate the harm he had done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne asked herself no questions. She was conscious of a curious
      excitement, and the sighing of the pines lulled her to sleep. But all
      night long she dreamed of Abel Newt, with bare head and clustering black
      hair, gracefully bowing, and murmuring excuses; and oh! so manly, oh! so
      heroic he looked as he carefully helped to lay Gabriel in the carriage.

      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; NEWS FROM HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abel found a letter waiting for him when he returned to the school. He
      tore it open and read it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR ABEL,&mdash;You have now nearly reached the age at which,
      by your grandfather&rsquo;s direction, you were to leave school and enter
      upon active life. Your grandfather, who had known and respected Mr. Gray
      in former years, left you, as you know, a sum sufficient for your
      education, upon condition of your being placed at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s until
      your nineteenth birthday. That time is approaching. Upon your nineteenth
      birthday you will leave school. Mr. Gray gives me the best accounts of
      you. My plans for you are not quite settled. What are your own wishes? It
      is late for you to think of college; and as you will undoubtedly be a
      business man, I see no need of your learning Greek or writing Latin
      poetry. At your age I was earning my own living. Your mother and the
      family are well. Your affectionate father,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;BONIFACE NEWT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Your mother wishes to add a line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR ABEL,&mdash;I am very glad to hear from Mr. Gray of your fine
      progress in study, and your general good character and deportment. I trust
      you give some of your leisure to solid reading. It is very necessary to
      improve the mind. I hope you attend to religion. It will help you if you
      keep a record of Dr. Peewee&rsquo;s texts, and write abstracts of his
      sermons. Grammar, too, and general manners. I hear that you are very
      self-possessed, which is really good news. My friend Mrs. Beacon was here
      last week, and she says you <i>bow beautifully</i>! That is a great deal
      for her to admit, for her son Bowdoin is one of the most elegant and
      presentable young men I have ever seen. He is very gentlemanly indeed. He
      and Alfred Dinks have been here for some time. My dear son, could you not
      learn to waltz before you come home? It is considered very bad by some
      people, because you have to put your arm round the lady&rsquo;s waist. But
      I think it is very foolish for any body to set themselves up against the
      customs of society. I think if it is permitted in Paris and London, we
      needn&rsquo;t be so very particular about it in New York. Mr. Dinks and
      Mr. Beacon both waltz, and I assure you it is very <i>distingué</i>
      indeed. But be careful in learning. Your sister Fanny says the Boston
      young men stick out their elbows dreadfully when they waltz, and look like
      owls spinning on invisible teetotums. She declares, too, that all the
      Boston girls are dowdy. But she is obliged to confess that Mr. Beacon and
      Mr. Dinks are as well dressed and gentlemanly and dance as well as our
      young men here. And as for the Boston ladies, Mr. Dinks tells Fanny that
      he has a cousin, a Miss Wayne, who lives in Delafield, who might alter her
      opinion of the dowdiness of Boston girls. It seems she is a great heiress,
      and very beautiful; and it is said here (but you know how idle such gossip
      is) that she is going to marry her cousin, Alfred Dinks. He does not deny
      it. He merely laughs and shakes his head&mdash;the truth is, he hasn&rsquo;t
      much to say for himself. Bless me! I&rsquo;ve got to take another sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Abel, my dear, do you know Miss Wayne? I have never heard you
      speak of her, and yet, if she lives in Delafield, you must know something
      about her. Your father is working hard at his business, but it is shocking
      how much money we have to spend to keep up our place in society properly.
      I know that he spends all his income every year; and if any thing should
      happen&mdash;I cry my eyes out to think of it. Miss Wayne, I hear, is very
      beautiful, and about your age. Is it true about her being an heiress?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the news&mdash;let me see. Oh! your cousin, Laura Magot, is
      engaged, and she has made a capital match. She will be eighteen on her
      next birthday; and the happy man is Mellish Whitloe. It is the fine old
      Knickerbocker family. Fanny says she knows all about them&mdash;that she
      has the Whitloes all at her fingers&rsquo; ends. You see she is as bright
      as ever. It is a capital match. Mr. Whitloe has at least five thousand
      dollars a year from his business now; and his aunt, Patience Doolittle,
      widow of the old merchant, who has no children, is understood to prefer
      him to all her relations. Laura will have a little something; so there
      could be nothing better. We are naturally delighted. But what a pity Laura
      is not a little taller&mdash;about Fanny&rsquo;s height; and as I was
      looking at Fanny the other day, I thought how sorry I was for Mr. Whitloe
      that Laura was not just a little prettier. She has <i>such</i> a nose; and
      then her complexion! However, my dear Abel of course cares nothing about
      such things, and, I have no doubt, is wickedly laughing at his mamma at
      this very moment for scribbling him such a long, rambling letter. What is
      Miss Wayne&rsquo;s first name? Is she fair or brunette? Don&rsquo;t forget
      to write me all you know. I am going to Saratoga in a few days&mdash;I
      think Fanny ought to drink the waters. I told Dr. Lush I was perfectly
      sure of it; so he told your father, and he has consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember Mrs. Plumer, the large, handsome woman from New
      Orleans, whom you saw when we dined at your Uncle Magot&rsquo;s last
      summer? She has come on, and will be at the Spring this year. I am told
      Mr. Plumer is a very large planter&mdash;the largest, some people say, in
      the country. Their oldest daughter, Grace is as school in town. She is
      only fourteen, I believe. What an heiress she will be! The Moultries, from
      South Carolina, will be there too, I suppose. By-the-by, now old is Sligo
      Moultrie? Then there are some of those rich Havana people coming. What
      diamonds they wear! It will be very pleasant at the Springs; and I hope
      the little visit will do Fanny good. Dr. Maundy is giving us a series of
      sermons upon the different kinds of wood used in building Solomon&rsquo;s
      Temple. They are very interesting; and he has such a flow of beautiful
      words and such wavy gestures, and he looks so gentlemanly in the pulpit,
      that I have no doubt he does a great deal of good. The church is always
      full. Your Uncle Lawrence has been to hear a preacher from Boston, by the
      name of Channing, and is very much pleased. Have you ever heard him? It
      seems he is very famous in his own sect, who are infidels, or deists, or
      pollywogs, or atheists&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which it is. I believe
      they preach mere morality, and read essays instead of sermons. I hope you
      go regularly to church; and from what I have heard of Dr. Peewee, I
      respect him very highly. Perhaps you had better make abstracts of his
      sermons, and I can look over them some time when you come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of religion, I must tell you a little story which Fanny
      told me the other day. She was coming home from church with Mr. Dinks, and
      he said to her, &lsquo;Miss Newt, what do you do when you go into church
      and put your head down?&rsquo; Fanny did not understand him, and asked him
      what he meant. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;when we go into church,
      you know, we all put our heads down in front of the pew, or in our hands,
      for a little while, and Dr. Maundy spreads his handkerchief on the desk
      and puts his face into it for quite a long time. What do <i>you</i> do?&rsquo;
      he asked, in a really perplexed way, Fanny says. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said
      she, gravely, &lsquo;Mr. Dinks, it is to say a short prayer.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I never thought of that.&rsquo;
      'Why, what do you do, then?&rsquo; asked Fanny, curiously. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
      answered Dinks, &lsquo;you know I think it&rsquo;s a capital thing to do;
      it&rsquo;s proper, and so forth; but I never knew what people were really
      at when they did it; so I always put my head into my hat and count ten. I
      find it comes to about the same thing&mdash;I get through at the same time
      with other people.&rsquo; He isn&rsquo;t very bright, but he is a
      good-hearted fellow, and very gentlemanly, and I am told he is very rich.
      Fanny laughs at him; but I think she likes him very well. I wish you would
      find out whether Miss Wayne really is engaged to him. Here I am at the
      very end of my paper. Take care of yourself, my dear Abel, and remember
      the religion and the solid reading.

    <p>
      Abel read the letters, and stood looking at the floor, musingly. His
      school days, then, were numbered; the stage was to be deepened and widened&mdash;the
      scenery and the figures so wonderfully changed! He was to step in a moment
      from school into the world. He was to lie down one night a boy, and wake
      up a man the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud of thoughts and fancies that filled his mind all drifted toward
      one point&mdash;all floated below a summit upon which stood the only thing
      he could discern clearly, and that was the figure of Hope Wayne. Just as
      he thought he could reach her, was he to be torn away?
    </p>
    <p>
      And who was Mr. Alfred Dinks?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; BEGINNING TO SKETCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning when Gabriel declared that he was perfectly well and had
      better return, nobody opposed his departure. Hope Wayne, indeed, ordered
      the carriage so readily that the poor boy&rsquo;s heart sank. Yet Hope
      pitied Gabriel sincerely. She wished he had not been injured, because then
      there would have been nobody guilty of injuring him; and she was quite
      willing he should go, because his presence reminded her too forcibly of
      what she wanted to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor boy drove dismally away, thinking what a dreadful thing it is to
      be young.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had gone Hope Wayne sat upon the lawn reading. Suddenly a shadow
      fell across the page, and looking up she saw Abel Newt standing beside
      her. He had his cap in one hand and a port-folio in the other. The blood
      rushed from Hope&rsquo;s cheek to her heart; then rushed back again. Abel
      saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising from the lawn and bowing gravely, she turned toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wayne,&rdquo; said Abel, in a voice which was very musical and
      very low&mdash;she stopped&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you have not already
      convicted and sentenced me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled a little as he spoke, not familiarly, not presumptuously, but
      with an air which indicated his entire ability to justify himself. Hope
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no wish to be unjust.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I then plead my own cause?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go into the house&mdash;I will call my grandfather, whom I
      suppose you wish to see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here by his permission, and I hope you will not regard me as
      an intruder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, if he knows you are here;&rdquo; and Hope lingered
      to hear if he had any thing more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very sudden affair. We were both hot and angry; but he is
      smaller than I, and I should have done nothing had he not struck me, and
      fallen upon me so that I was obliged to defend myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;to be sure&mdash;in that case,&rdquo; said Hope, still
      lingering, and remarking the music of his voice. Abel continued&mdash;while
      the girl&rsquo;s eyes saw how well he looked upon that lawn&mdash;the
      clustering black hair&mdash;the rich eyes&mdash;the dark complexion&mdash;the
      light of intelligence playing upon his face&mdash;his dress careful but
      graceful&mdash;and the port-folio which showed this interview to be no
      design or expectation, but a mere chance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry you should have had the pain of seeing such a
      spectacle, and I am ashamed my first introduction to you should have been
      at such a time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne lingered, looking on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, indeed,&rdquo; continued Abel, &ldquo;that you owe me an
      opportunity of making a better impression.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope! Hope!&rdquo; came floating the sound of a distant voice
      calling in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne turned her head toward the voice, but her eyes looked upon the
      ground, and her feet still lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known you so long, and yet have never spoken to you,&rdquo;
      said the musical voice at her side; &ldquo;I have seen you so constantly
      in church, and I have even tried sometimes&mdash;I confess it&mdash;to
      catch a glance from you as you came out. But I am not sorry, for now&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope! Hope!&rdquo; called the voice from the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope looked dreamily in that direction, not as if she heard it, but as if
      she were listening to something in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I meet you here on this lovely lawn in your own beautiful home.
      Do you know that your grandfather permits me to sketch the place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you draw, Mr. Newt?&rdquo; asked Hope Wayne, in a tone which
      seemed to Abel to trickle along his nerves, so exquisite and prolonged was
      the pleasure it gave him to hear her call him by name. How did she know
      it? thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I draw, and am very fond of it,&rdquo; he answered, as he
      untied his port-folio. &ldquo;I do not dare to say that I am proud of my
      drawing&mdash;and yet you may perhaps recognize this, if you will look a
      moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope! Hope!&rdquo; came the voice again from the garden. Abel heard
      it&mdash;perhaps Hope did not. He was busily opening his port-folio and
      turning over the drawings, and stepped closer to her, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! now, what is that?&rdquo; and he handed her a sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope looked at it and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the farther shore of the pond with the spire; how very
      pretty it is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is the old church, and there is Mr. Gray&rsquo;s face at
      the window. How good they are! You draw very well, Mr. Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you draw, Miss Wayne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had plenty of lessons,&rdquo; replied Hope, smiling;
      &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t draw from nature very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you sketch, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, scenes and figures out of books.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very pleasant that must be! That&rsquo;s a better style than
      mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we can never draw any thing as handsome as it seems to us.
      You can go and see the pond with your own eyes, and then no picture will
      seem worth having.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;There is another reason, too,
      I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Hope, looking at her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, smiling, &ldquo;because life in books is
      always so much better than real life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; said Hope, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly. People are always brave, and beautiful, and good,
      in books. An author may make them do and say just what he and all the
      world want them to, and it all seems right. And then they do such
      splendidly impossible things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now, if you and I were in a book at this moment, instead of
      standing on this lawn, I might be a knight slaying a great dragon that was
      just coming to destroy you, and you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope, Hope!&rdquo; rang the voice from the garden, nearer and more
      imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&mdash;might be saved by another knight dashing in upon you,
      like that voice upon your sentence,&rdquo; said Hope, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered Abel, laughing, &ldquo;that shouldn&rsquo;t
      be in the book. I should slay the great dragon who would desolate all
      Delafield with the swishing of his scaly tail; then you would place a
      wreath upon my head, and all the people would come out and salute me for
      saving the Princess whom they loved, and I&rdquo;&mdash;said Abel, after a
      momentary pause, a shade more gravely, and in a tone a little lower&mdash;&ldquo;and
      I, as I rode away, should not wonder that they loved her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked across the lawn under the pine-trees as if he were thinking of
      some story that he had been actually reading. Hope smiled no longer, but
      said, quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt, I am wanted. I must go in. Good-morning!&rdquo; And she
      moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your cousin Alfred Dinks has arrived,&rdquo; said Abel,
      carelessly, as he closed his port-folio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne stopped, and, standing very erect, turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know my cousin, Mr. Dinks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that I had such a cousin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it somewhere,&rdquo; answered Abel, gently and
      respectfully, but looking at Hope with a curious glance which seemed to
      her to penetrate every pore in her body. That glance said as plainly as
      words could have said, &ldquo;And I heard you were engaged to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne looked serious for a moment; then she said, with a half smile,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is no secret that Alfred Dinks is my cousin;&rdquo;
      and, bowing to Abel, she went swiftly over the lawn toward the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; A VERDICT AND A SENTENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne did not agree with Abel Newt that life was so much better in
      books. There was nothing better in any book she had ever read than the
      little conversation with the handsome youth which she had had that morning
      upon the lawn. When she went into the house she found no one until she
      knocked at Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunty, did you call me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the lawn, Aunty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady did not ask her why she had not sought her there, but she
      asked, &ldquo;What do you want, Aunty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman looked quietly out of the window. Neither spoke for a long
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you talking with Abel Newt on the lawn. Why did he strike
      that boy?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Simcoe at length, still gazing at the distant
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had to defend himself,&rdquo; said Hope, rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t a young man protect himself against a boy without
      stunning him? He might easily have killed him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Simcoe, in
      the same dry tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very unfortunate, and Mr. Newt says so; but I don&rsquo;t
      think he is to bear every thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the other do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He insulted him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which the elderly woman spoke was trying. Hope was flushed,
      and warm, and disconcerted. There was so much skepticism and contempt in
      the single word &ldquo;indeed!&rdquo; as Mrs. Simcoe pronounced it, that
      Hope was really angry with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should treat Mr. Newt in that manner,&rdquo;
      said she, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what manner, Hope?&rdquo; asked the other, calmly, fixing her
      eyes upon her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that sneering, contemptuous manner,&rdquo; replied Hope,
      loftily. &ldquo;Here is a young man who falls into an unfortunate quarrel,
      in which he happens to get the better of his opponent, who chances to be
      younger. He helps him carefully into the carriage. He explains upon the
      spot as well as he can, and to-day he comes to explain further; and you
      will not believe him; you misunderstand and misrepresent him. It is
      unkind, Aunty&mdash;unkind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope was almost sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he once said he was sorry?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Simcoe. &ldquo;Has
      he told you so this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is sorry, Aunty. How could he help it? Do you suppose
      he is a brute? Do you suppose he hasn&rsquo;t ordinary human feeling? Why
      do you treat him so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope asked the question almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe sat profoundly still, and said nothing. Her face seemed to
      grow even more rigid as she sat. But suddenly turning to the proud young
      girl who stood at her side, her bosom heaving with passion, she drew her
      toward her by both hands, pulled her face down close to hers, and kissed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope sank on her knees by the side of Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s chair. All the
      pride in her heart was melted, and poured out of her eyes. She buried her
      face upon Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s shoulder, and her passion wept and sobbed
      itself away. She did not understand what it was, nor why. A little while
      before, upon the lawn, she had been so happy. Now it seemed as if her
      heart were breaking. When she grew calmer, Mrs. Simcoe, holding the fair
      face between her hands, and tenderly kissing it once more, said, slowly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope, my child, we must all walk the path alone. But you, too, will
      learn that our human affections are but tents of a night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunty, Aunty, what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Hope, who had risen as
      the other was speaking, and now stood beside her, pale and proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, Hope, that you are in love with Abel Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope&rsquo;s hands dropped by her side. She stepped back a little. A
      feeling of inexpressible solitude fell upon her&mdash;of alienation from
      her grandfather, and of an inexplicable separation from her old nurse&mdash;a
      feeling as if she suddenly stood alone in the world&mdash;as if she had
      ceased to be a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunty, is it wrong to love him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mrs. Simcoe could answer there was a knock at the door. It was
      Hiram, who announced the victim of yesterday&rsquo;s battle, waiting in
      the parlor to say a word to Miss Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Hiram.&rdquo; He bowed and withdrew. Hope Wayne stood at the
      window silent for a little while, then, with the calm, lofty air&mdash;calmer
      and loftier than ever&mdash;she went down and found Gabriel Bennet. He had
      come to thank her&mdash;to say how much better he was&mdash;how sorry that
      he should have been so disgraced as to have been fighting almost before
      her very eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I was very foolish and furious,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Abel
      ran against me, and I got very angry and struck him. It was wrong; I know
      it was, and I am very sorry. But, ma&rsquo;am, I hope you won&rsquo;t&mdash;ch&mdash;ch&mdash;I
      mean, won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That unlucky &ldquo;ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; had choked all his other words.
      Hope was so lofty and splendid in his eyes as she stood before him that he
      was impressed with a kind of awe. But the moment he had spoken to her as
      if he were only a little boy and she a woman, he was utterly confused. He
      staggered and stumbled in his sentence until Hope graciously said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blame nobody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor Gabriel&rsquo;s speech was gone. His mouth was parched and his
      mind dry. He could not think of a word to say; and, twisting and fumbling
      his cap, did not know how to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Miss Wayne!&rdquo; suddenly said a voice at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope and Gabriel turned at the same moment, and beheld Abel Newt entering
      the room gayly, with a sketch in his hand. He nodded to Gabriel without
      speaking, but went directly to Hope and showed her the drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that will do for a beginning, will it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bold, dashing sketch. The pine-trees, the windows, the piazzas&mdash;yes,
      she saw them all. They had a new charm in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tree comes a little nearer that window,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it does?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You, who only
      draw from books?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I ought to know the tree that I see every day at my own
      window!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is your window!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel was confounded at this sudden incursion and apparent resumption of
      a previous conversation. As he ran up the avenue he had not remarked Abel
      sketching on the lawn. But Abel, sketching on the lawn, had observed
      Gabriel running up the avenue, and therefore happened in to ask Miss Wayne&rsquo;s
      opinion of his drawing. He chatted merrily on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s your grandpapa when he was a little grand-baby
      and had an old grandpapa in his turn,&rdquo; said he, pointing at the
      portrait he had remarked upon his previous visit in that parlor. &ldquo;What
      a funny little old fellow! Let me see. Gracious! &lsquo;twas before the
      Revolution. Ah! now, if he could only speak and tell us just what he saw
      in the room where they were painting him&mdash;what he had for breakfast,
      for instance&mdash;what those dear little ridiculous waistcoats, with all
      their flowery embroidery, cost a yard, say&mdash;yes, yes, and what book
      that is&mdash;and who gave him the hoop&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rattled on. Never in Hope&rsquo;s lifetime had such sounds of gay
      speech been heard in that well-arranged and well-behaved parlor. They
      seemed to light it up. The rapid talk bubbled like music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoop and book&mdash;book and hoop! Oh yes. Good boy, very good boy,&rdquo;
      said Abel, laughing. &ldquo;I should think it was a portrait of the young
      Dr. Peewee&mdash;the wee Peewee, Miss Hope,&rdquo; said the audacious
      youth, sliding, as it were, unconsciously and naturally into greater
      familiarity. &ldquo;Ah! I know you know all his sermons by heart, for you
      never look away from him. What on earth are they all about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast to Gabriel&rsquo;s awkward silence of the moment before!
      Such a handsome face! such a musical voice!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of it all Hiram was heard remonstrating outside:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Sir, don&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll&mdash;something
      will happen, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s scuffling and trampling, and Christopher Burt,
      restrained by Hiram, burst into the room. The old man was white with
      wrath. He had his cane in one hand, and Hiram held the other hand and arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come in from the garden, and as he stopped in the dining-room to
      take a little trip to the West Indies, he had heard voices in the
      drawing-room. Summoning Hiram to know if they were visitors, he had
      learned the awful truth which apprised him that his Hesperidian wall was
      down, and that the robbers at that very moment might be shaking his
      precious fruit from the boughs. To be sure he had himself left the gate
      open. Do you think, then, it helps a man&rsquo;s temper to be as furious
      with himself as with other people? He burst into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood Hope: Abel at her side, in the merry midst of his talk, with
      his sketch in his hand, his port-folio under his arm, and his finger
      pointed toward the portrait; Gabriel, at a little distance, confounded and
      abashed by an acquaintance between Hope and Abel of which he had no
      previous suspicion. The poor boy! forgotten by Hope, and purposely
      trampled down by the eager talk of Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope, go up stairs!&rdquo; shouted the old gentleman. &ldquo;And
      what are you doing in my house, you scamps?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his cane as he came toward them. &ldquo;I knew all this fighting
      business yesterday was a conspiracy&mdash;a swindling cheat to get into
      this house! I&rsquo;ve a mind to break your impudent bones!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;you gave me leave to come here
      and sketch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I give you leave to come into my parlor and bring boys with
      you, Sir, and take up the time of my grand-daughter? Hope, I say, go up
      stairs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only thought, Sir&mdash;&rdquo; began Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, don&rsquo;t make me angry, Sir!&rdquo;
      burst in the old gentleman, almost foaming at the mouth. &ldquo;Why should
      you think, Sir? What business have you to think, Sir? You&rsquo;re a boy,
      Sir&mdash;a school-boy, Sir! Are you going to dispute with me in my own
      house? I take back my permission. Go, both of you! and never let me see
      your faces again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stood pointing with his cane toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, both of you!&rdquo; repeated he, fiercely. It was impossible to
      resist; and Abel and Gabriel moved slowly toward the door. The former was
      furious at finding himself doomed in company with Gabriel. But he betrayed
      nothing. He was preternaturally calm. Hope, dismayed and pale, stood
      looking on, but saying nothing. Gabriel went quietly out of the room. Abel
      turned to the door, and bowed gravely to Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Sir,&rdquo; cried the old man, &ldquo;I take back my
      permission!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, Sir,&rdquo; replied Abel, bowing to him also.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door; and as he did so it seemed to Hope Wayne as if the
      sunshine were extinguished.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; HELP, HO!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abel Newt was fully aware that his time was short. His father&rsquo;s
      letter had apprised him of his presently leaving school. To leave school&mdash;was
      it not to quit Delafield? Might it not be to lose Hope Wayne? He was
      banished from Pinewood. There were flaming swords of suspicion waving over
      that flowery gate. The days were passing. The summer is ending, thought
      he, and I am by no means saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither he nor Gabriel had mentioned their last visit to Pinewood and its
      catastrophe. It was a secret better buried in their own bosoms. Abel&rsquo;s
      dislike of the other was deepened and imbittered by the ignominy of the
      expulsion by Mr. Burt, of which Gabriel had been not only a companion but
      a witness. It was an indignity that made Abel tingle whenever he thought
      of it. He fancied Gabriel thinking of it too, and laughing at him in his
      sleeve, and he longed to thrash him. But Gabriel had much better business.
      He was thinking only of Hope Wayne, and laughing at himself for thinking
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were strolling in different parts of the village. Abel, into
      whose mind had stolen that thought of the possible laughter in Gabriel&rsquo;s
      sleeve, pulled out his handkerchief suddenly, and waved it with an
      indignant movement in the air. At the same moment a carriage had overtaken
      him and was passing. The horses, startled by the shock of the waving
      handkerchief, shied and broke into a run. The coachman tried in vain to
      control them. They sprang forward and had their heads in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked up, and saw that it was the Burt carriage dashing down the
      road. He flew after, and every boy followed. The horses, maddened by the
      cries of the coachman and passers-by, by the rattling of the carriage, and
      their own excitement and speed, plunged on with fearful swiftness. As the
      carriage flew by, two faces were seen at the window&mdash;both calm, but
      one terrified. They were those of Hope and Mrs. Simcoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop &lsquo;em! stop &lsquo;em!&rdquo; rang the cry along the
      village street; and the idling villagers looked from the windows or came
      to the doors&mdash;the women exclaiming and holding up their hands, the
      men leaving whatever they were doing and joining the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole village was in motion. Every body knew Hope Wayne&mdash;every
      body loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both she and Mrs. Simcoe sat quietly in the carriage. They knew it was
      madness to leap&mdash;that their only chance lay in remaining perfectly
      quiet. They both knew the danger&mdash;they knew that every instant they
      were hovering on the edge of death or accident. How strange to Hope&rsquo;s
      eyes, in those swift moments, looked the familiar houses&mdash;the trees&mdash;the
      signs&mdash;the fences&mdash;as they swept by! How peaceful and secure
      they were! How far away they seemed! She read the names distinctly. She
      thought of little incidents connected with all the places. Her mind, and
      memory, and perception were perfectly clear; but her hands were clenched,
      and her cheek cold and pale with vague terror. Mrs. Simcoe sat beside her,
      calmly holding one of Hope&rsquo;s hands, but neither of them spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage struck a stone, and the crowd shuddered as they saw it rock
      and swing in its furious course. The mad horses but flew more wildly. Mrs.
      Simcoe pressed Hope&rsquo;s hand, and murmured, almost inaudibly,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Christ shall bless thy going out,
  Shall bless thy coming in;
Kindly compass thee about,
  Till thou art saved from sin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That corner! that corner!&rdquo; shouted the throng, as the horses
      neared a sudden turn into a side-road, toward which they seemed to be
      making, frightened by the persons who came running toward them on the main
      street. Among these was Gabriel, who, hearing the confused murmur that
      rang down the road, turned and recognized the carriage that was whirled
      along at the mercy of wild horses. He seemed to his companions to fly as
      he went&mdash;to himself he seemed to be standing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carefully, carefully!&rdquo; cried the others, as they saw his
      impetuosity. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be trampled!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel did not hear. He only saw the fatal corner. He only knew that Hope
      Wayne was in danger&mdash;that the carriage, already swaying, would be
      overturned&mdash;might be dashed in pieces, and Hope&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came near as the horses were about turning. The street toward which
      they were heading was narrow, and on the other corner from him there was a
      wall. They were running toward Gabriel down the main road; but just as he
      came up with them he flung himself with all his might toward the animals&rsquo;
      heads. The startled horses half-recoiled, turned sharply and suddenly&mdash;dashed
      themselves against the wall&mdash;and the carriage stood still. In a
      moment a dozen men had secured them, and the danger was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, and the ladies stepped out. Mrs. Simcoe was pale, but
      her heart had not quailed. The faith that sustains a woman&rsquo;s heart
      in life does not fail when death brushes her with his finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child!&rdquo; she said to Hope, when they both knew that the
      crisis was over, and her lips moved in silent prayer and thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope herself was trembling and silent. In her inmost heart she hoped it
      was Abel Newt who had saved them. But in all the throng she did not see
      his face. She felt a secret disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is your preserver, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said one of the
      villagers, pushing Gabriel forward. Mrs. Simcoe actually smiled. She put
      out her hand to him kindly; and Hope, with grave Sweetness, told him how
      great was their obligation. The boy bowed and looked at her earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, not at all,&rdquo; replied Hope, smiling, and not without
      some effort, because she fancied that Gabriel looked at her as if she
      showed some sign of pain&mdash;or disappointment&mdash;or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are perfectly well, thanks to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What started the horses?&rdquo; asked Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel Newt started them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Simcoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope reddened and looked at her companion. &ldquo;What do you mean, Aunty?&rdquo;
      asked she, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe was explaining, when Abel came up out of breath and alarmed.
      In a moment he saw that there had been no injury. Hope&rsquo;s eyes met
      his, and the color slowly died away from her cheeks. He eagerly asked how
      it happened, and was confounded by hearing that he was the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange it is,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, to Hope, as the
      people busied themselves in looking after the horses and carriage, and
      Gabriel talked to Mrs. Simcoe, with whom he found conversation so much
      easier than with Hope&mdash;&ldquo;how strange it is that just as I was
      wondering when and where and how I should see you again, I should meet you
      in this way, Miss Wayne!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleased, still weak and trembling, pale and flushed by turns, Hope
      listened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where <i>can</i> I see you?&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;certainly
      your grandfather was unkind&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope shook her head slowly. Abel watched every movement&mdash;every look&mdash;every
      fluctuating change of manner and color, as if he knew its most hidden
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see you nowhere but at home,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply. She stood silent. She wished he would speak. The silence
      was dreadful. She could not bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said she, in a whisper, her eyes fastened
      upon the ground, her hands playing with her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are,&rdquo; he said, quietly, with a tone of sadness,
      not of reproach. There was another painful pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, because I am going away,&rdquo; said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few weeks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In New York.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very much to the point. Yet both of them wanted to say so much
      more; and neither of them dared!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hope!&rdquo; whispered Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope heard the musical whisper. She perceived the audacity of the
      familiarity, but she did not wish it were otherwise. She bent her head a
      little lower, as if listening more intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see you before I go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope was silent. Dr. Livingstone relates that when the lion had struck him
      with his paw, upon a certain occasion, he lay in a kind of paralysis, of
      which he would have been cured in a moment more by being devoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; said Mrs. Simcoe, &ldquo;the horses will be brought
      up. We had better walk home. Here, my dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only see you at home,&rdquo; Hope said, in a low voice, as
      she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we part here forever,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no reproach; it was only a deep sadness which softened
      that musical voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever!&rdquo; he repeated slowly, with low, remorseless music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne trembled, but he did not see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, too,&rdquo; she said, in a hurried whisper, as she
      moved slowly toward Mrs. Simcoe. Abel Newt was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by forever, Miss Wayne!&rdquo; he said. He could not see Hope&rsquo;s
      paler face as she heard the more formal address, and knew by it that he
      was offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; was all he caught as Hope Wayne took Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s
      arm and walked away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; SOCIETY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tradition declares that the family of Newt has been uniformly respectable
      but honest&mdash;so respectable, indeed, that Mr. Boniface Newt, the
      father of Abel, a celebrated New York merchant and a Tammany Sachem, had a
      crest. He had even buttons for his coachman&rsquo;s coat with a stag&rsquo;s
      head engraved upon them. The same device was upon his sealring. It
      appeared upon his carriage door. It figured on the edges of his
      dinner-service. It was worked into the ground glass of the door that led
      from his dining-room to the back stairs. He had his paper stamped with it;
      and a great many of his neighbors, thinking it a neat and becoming
      ornament, imitated him in its generous use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt&rsquo;s family had a crest also. She was a Magot&mdash;another
      of the fine old families which came to this country at the earliest
      possible period. The Magots, however, had no buttons upon their coachman&rsquo;s
      coat; one reason of which omission was, perhaps, that they had no
      coachman. But when the ladies of the Magot family went visiting or
      shopping they hired a carriage, and insisted that the driver should brush
      his hat and black his boots; so that it was not every body who knew that
      it was a livery equipage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their friends did, of course; but there were a great many people from the
      country who gazed at it, in passing, with the same emotion with which they
      would have contemplated a private carriage; which was highly gratifying to
      the feelings of the Magots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their friends knew it, but friends never remark upon such things. There
      was old Mrs. Beriah Dagon&mdash;dowager Mrs. Dagon, she was called&mdash;aunt
      of Mr. Newt, who never said, &ldquo;I see the Magots have hired a
      hackney-coach from Jobbers to make calls in. They quarreled with Gudging
      over his last bill. Medora Magot has turned her last year&rsquo;s silk,
      which is a little stained and worn; but then it does just as well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by her nephew Boniface married Medora&rsquo;s sister, Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Dagon who sat with Mrs. Newt in her parlor, and said to her,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your son Abel is coming home. I&rsquo;m glad to hear it. I hope
      he knows how to waltz, and isn&rsquo;t awkward. There are some very good
      matches to be made; and I like to have a young man settle early. It&rsquo;s
      better for his morals. Men are bad people, my dear. I think Maria
      Chubleigh would do very well for Abel. She had a foolish affair with that
      Colonel Orson, but it&rsquo;s all over. Why on earth do girls fall in love
      with officers? They never have any pay worth speaking of, and a girl must
      tramp all over the land, and live I don&rsquo;t know how. Pshaw! it&rsquo;s
      a wretched business. How&rsquo;s Mr. Dinks? I saw him and Fanny waltzing
      last month at the Shrimps&rsquo;. Who are the Shrimps? Somebody says
      something about the immense fortune Mr. Shrimp has made in the oil trade.
      You should have seen Mrs. Winslow Orry peering about at the Shrimps. I
      really believe she counted the spoons. What an eye that woman has, and
      what a tongue! Are you really going to Saratoga? Will Boniface let you? He
      is the kindest man! He is so generous that I sometimes fear somebody&rsquo;ll
      be taking advantage of him. Gracious me! how hot it is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was warm, and Mrs. Dagon fanned herself. When she and Mrs. Newt met
      there was a tremendous struggle to get the first innings of the
      conversation, and neither surrendered the ground until fairly forced off
      by breathlessness and exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we shall go to Saratoga,&rdquo; began Mrs. Newt; &ldquo;and I
      want Abel to come, so as to take him. There&rsquo;ll be a very pleasant
      season. What a pity you can&rsquo;t go! However, people must regard their
      time of life, and take care of their health. There&rsquo;s old Mrs.
      Octoyne says she shall never give up. She hopes to bring out her
      great-grand-daughter next winter, and says she has no life but in society.
      I suppose you know Herbert Octoyne is engaged to one of the Shrimps. They
      keep their carriage, and the girls dress very prettily. Herbert tells the
      young men that the Shrimps are a fine old family, which has been long out
      of society, having no daughters to marry; so they have not been obliged to
      appear. But I don&rsquo;t know about visiting them. However, I suppose we
      shall. Herbert Octoyne will give &lsquo;em family, if they really haven&rsquo;t
      it; and the Octoynes won&rsquo;t be sorry for her money. What a pretty
      shawl! Did you hear that Mellish Whitloe has given Laura a diamond pin
      which cost five hundred dollars? Extravagant fellow! Yet I like to have
      young men do these things handsomely. I do think it&rsquo;s such a pity
      about Laura&rsquo;s nose&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can smell with it, I suppose, mother; and what else do you want
      of a nose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Miss Fanny Newt who spoke, and who had entered the room during the
      conversation. She was a tall young woman of about twenty, with firm, dark
      eyes, and abundant dark hair, and that kind of composure of manner which
      is called repose in drawing-rooms and boldness in bar-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious, Fanny, how you do disturb one! I didn&rsquo;t know you
      were there. Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. Of course she can smell with it.
      But that isn&rsquo;t all you want of a nose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you want it to turn up at some people,&rdquo; replied
      Miss Fanny, smoothing her dress, and looking in the glass. &ldquo;Well,
      Aunt Dagon, who&rsquo;ve you been lunching on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Dagon looked a little appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, what do you mean?&rdquo; she said, fanning herself
      violently. &ldquo;I hope I never say any thing that isn&rsquo;t true about
      people. I&rsquo;m sure I should be very sorry to hurt any body&rsquo;s
      feelings. There&rsquo;s Mrs. Kite&mdash;you know, Joseph Kite&rsquo;s
      wife, the man they said really did cheat his creditors, only none of
      &lsquo;em would swear to it; well, Kitty Kite, my dear, does do and say
      the most abominable things about people. At the Shrimps&rsquo; ball, when
      you were waltzing with Mr. Dinks, I heard her say to Mrs. Orry, &lsquo;Do
      look at Fanny Newt hug that man!&rsquo; It was dreadful to hear her say
      such things, my dear; and then to see the whole room stare at you! It was
      cruel&mdash;it was really unfeeling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny did not wince. She merely said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is Mrs. Kite, Aunt Dagon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me see; she&rsquo;s about my age, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well, Aunt, people at her time of life can&rsquo;t see or hear
      much, you know. They ought to be in their beds with hot bottles at their
      feet, and not obtrude themselves among people who are young enough to
      enjoy life with all their senses,&rdquo; replied Miss Fanny, carelessly
      arranging a stray lock of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Miss, you would like to shove all the married people into
      the wall, or into their graves,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Dagon, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, dear Aunt, only into their beds&mdash;and that not until
      they are superannuated, which, you know, old people never find out for
      themselves,&rdquo; answered Fanny, smiling sweetly and calmly upon Mrs.
      Dagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a country it is, Aunt!&rdquo; said Mrs. Newt, looking at Fanny
      with a kind of admiration. &ldquo;How the young people take every thing
      into their own hands! Dear me! dear me! how they do rule us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Newt made no observation, but took up a gayly-bound book from the
      table and looked carelessly into it. Mrs. Dagon rose to go. She had
      somewhat recovered her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I believed it, dear,&rdquo; said she to Fanny, in
      whom, perhaps, she recognized some of the family character. &ldquo;No, no&mdash;not
      at all! I said to every body in the room that I didn&rsquo;t believe what
      Mrs. Kite said, that you were hugging Mr. Dinks in the waltz. I believe I
      spoke to every body I knew, and they all said they didn&rsquo;t believe it
      either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind it was of you, dear Aunt Dagon!&rdquo; said Fanny, as she
      rose to salute her departing relative, &ldquo;and how generous people were
      not to believe it! But I couldn&rsquo;t persuade them that that beautiful
      lace-edging on your dress was real Mechlin, although I tried very hard.
      They said it was natural in me to insist upon it, because I was your
      grand-niece; and it was no matter at all, because old ladies could do just
      as they pleased; but for all that it was not Mechlin. I must have told as
      many as thirty people that they were wrong. But people&rsquo;s eyes are so
      sharp&mdash;it&rsquo;s really dreadful. Good-morning, darling Aunt Dagon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny dear,&rdquo; said her mother, as the door closed upon Mrs.
      Dagon, who departed speechless and in what may be called a simmering state
      of mind, &ldquo;Abel will be here in a day or two. I really hope to hear
      something about this Miss Wayne. Do you suppose Alfred Dinks is actually
      engaged to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know, mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear, you have been so intimate with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mother, how <i>can</i> any body be intimate with Alfred
      Dinks? You might as well talk of breathing in a vacuum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Fanny, he is a very good sort of young man&mdash;so
      respectable, and with such good manners, and he has a very pretty fortune&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt was interrupted by the servant, who announced Mr. Wetherley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Zephyr Wetherley! He was one of the rank and file of society&mdash;one
      of the privates, so to speak, who are mentioned in a mass after a ball, as
      common soldiers are mentioned after a battle. He entered the room and
      bowed. Mrs. Newt seeing that it was one of her daughter&rsquo;s visitors,
      left the room. Miss Fanny sat looking at the young man with her black eyes
      so calmly that she seemed to him to be sitting a great way off in a cool
      darkness. Miss Fanny was not fond of Mr. Wetherley, although she had seen
      plainly enough the indications of his feeling for her. This morning he was
      well gloved and booted. His costume was unexceptionable. Society of that
      day boasted few better-dressed men than Zephyr Wetherley. His judgment in
      a case of cravat was unerring. He had been in Europe, and was quoted when
      waistcoats were in debate. He had been very attentive to Mr. Alfred Dinks
      and Mr. Bowdoin Beacon, the two Boston youths who had been charming
      society during the season that was now over. He was even a little jealous
      of Mr. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mrs. Newt had left the room Mr. Wetherley fell into confusion. He
      immediately embarked, of course, upon the weather; while Fanny, taking up
      a book, looked casually into it with a slight air of <i>ennui</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read this?&rdquo; said she to Mr. Wetherley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not; eh! what is it?&rdquo; replied Zephyr, who was
      not a reading man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is John Meal&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rachel Dyer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! No, indeed. I have not read it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you read, Mr. Wetherley?&rdquo; inquired Fanny, glancing
      through the book which she held in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&mdash;&rdquo; he began. Then he seemed to undergo some
      internal spasm. He dropped his hat, slid his chair to the side of Fanny&rsquo;s,
      and said, &ldquo;Ah, Miss Newt, how can you ask me at such a moment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fanny looked at him with a perfectly unruffled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not at this moment, Mr. Wetherley?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Newt, how can you when you know my feelings? Did you not
      carry my bouquet at the theatre last evening? Have you not long authorized
      me by your treatment to declare&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Mr. Wetherley,&rdquo; said Fanny, calmly. &ldquo;The day is
      warm&mdash;let us be cool. Don&rsquo;t say any thing which you will regret
      to remember. Don&rsquo;t mistake any thing that I have done as an
      indication of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Newt,&rdquo; interrupted Zephyr, &ldquo;how can you say
      such things? Hear me but one word. I assure you that I most deeply,
      tenderly, truly&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wetherley,&rdquo; said Fanny, putting down the book and
      speaking very firmly, &ldquo;I really can not sit still and hear you
      proceed. You are laboring under a great misapprehension. You must be aware
      that I have never in the slightest way given you occasion to believe that
      I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must speak!&rdquo; burst in the impetuous Zephyr. &ldquo;My
      feelings forbid silence! Great Heavens! Miss Newt, you really have no idea&mdash;I
      am sure you have no idea&mdash;you can not have any idea of the ardor with
      which for a long, long time I have&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wetherley,&rdquo; said Fanny Newt, darker and cooler than ever,
      &ldquo;it is useless to prolong this conversation. I can not consent to
      hear you declare that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t heard me declare it,&rdquo; replied Zephyr,
      vehemently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very thing I am trying to do, and you
      won&rsquo;t let me. You keep cutting me off just as I am saying how I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need go no further, Sir,&rdquo; said Miss Newt, coldly, rising
      and standing by the table; while Zephyr Wetherley, red and hot and
      confused, crushed his handkerchief into a ball, and swept his hand through
      his hair, wagging his foot, and rubbing his fingers together. &ldquo;I
      understand, Sir, what you wish to say, and I desire to tell you only&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I don&rsquo;t want to hear! Oh dear me! Please, please,
      Miss Newt!&rdquo; entreated Zephyr Wetherley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wetherley,&rdquo; interrupted the other, imperiously, &ldquo;you
      wish to ask me to marry you. I desire to spare you the pain of my answer
      to that question by preventing your asking it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherley was confounded. He wrinkled his brows doubtfully a moment&mdash;he
      stared at the floor and at Miss Newt&mdash;he looked foolish and
      mortified. &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; stammered he.
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;but&mdash;why&mdash;but&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you somehow
      answered the question?&rdquo; inquired he, with gleams of doubtful
      intelligence shooting across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt smiled icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Zephyr was bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very confusing, somehow, Miss Newt, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      said he, wiping his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Wetherley; one should always look before he leaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; oh, indeed, yes. A man had better look out, or&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or he&rsquo;ll catch a Tartar!&rdquo; said a clear, strange voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt and Wetherley turned simultaneously toward the speaker. It was
      a young man, with clustering black hair and sparkling eyes, in a traveling
      dress. He stood in the back room, which he had entered through the
      conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel!&rdquo; said his sister, running toward him, and pulling him
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wetherley, this is my brother, Mr. Abel Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Zephyr. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d he come here
      listening?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance, chance, Mr. Wetherley. I have just returned from school.
      Pretty tough old school-boy, hey? Well, it&rsquo;s all the grandpa&rsquo;s
      doing. Grandpas are extraordinary beings, Mr. Wetherley. Now there was&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! Really, I must go. Good-morning, Miss Newt.
      Good-morning, Sir.&rdquo; And Mr. Zephyr Wetherley departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother and sister laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensible fellow,&rdquo; said Abel; &ldquo;he flies the grandpas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come here, you wretch!&rdquo; asked Fanny, &ldquo;listening
      to my secrets?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I arrived this morning, only half an hour ago. I let
      myself in by my pass-key, and, hearing voices in the parlor, I went round
      by the conservatory to spy out the land. Then and there I beheld this
      spectacle. Fanny, you&rsquo;re wonderful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Newt made a demure courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve really come home for good? Well, Abel, I&rsquo;m
      glad. Now you&rsquo;re here I shall have a man of my own to attend me next
      winter. And there&rsquo;s to be the handsome Boston bride here, you know,
      next season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; said Abel, laughing, sinking into a chair.
      &ldquo;Mother wrote me you said that all Boston girls are dowdy. Who is
      the dowdy of next winter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Alfred Dinks,&rdquo; replied Fanny, carelessly, but looking
      with her keenest glance at Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, sprang up and began to say something; but his sister&rsquo;s eye
      arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said he, hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;Dinks, I&rsquo;ve
      heard about Alfred Dinks. What a devil of a name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, dear, you&rsquo;d better go up stairs and see mamma,&rdquo;
      said Fanny; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m so sorry you missed Aunt Dagon. She was
      here this morning, lovely as ever. But I think the velvet is wearing off
      her claws.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt laughed a cold little laugh. Abel went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Abel, then, does know Miss Hope Wayne,&rdquo; said she to
      herself. &ldquo;He more than knows her&mdash;he loves her&mdash;or thinks
      he does. Wouldn&rsquo;t he have known if she had been engaged to her
      cousin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She pondered a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; thought Miss Fanny, &ldquo;that she
      is engaged to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fanny was pleased with that thought, because she meant to be engaged
      to him herself, if it proved to be true, as every body declared, that he
      had ten or fifteen thousand a year.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; A NEW YORK MERCHANT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Lawrence Newt, the brother of Boniface, sat in his office. It was upon
      South Street, and the windows looked out upon the shipping in the East
      River&mdash;upon the ferry-boats incessantly crossing&mdash;upon the lofty
      city of Brooklyn opposite, with its spires. He heard the sailors sing&mdash;the
      oaths of the stevedores&mdash;the bustle of the carts, and the hum and
      scuffle of the passers-by. As he sat at his table he saw the ships haul
      into the stream&mdash;the little steamers that puffed alongside bringing
      the passengers; then, if the wind were not fair, pulling and shoving the
      huge hulks into a space large enough for them to manage themselves in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he watched the parting of passengers at the wharf when the wind
      was fair, and the ship could sail from her berth. The vast sails were
      slowly unfurled, were shaken out, hung for a few moments, then shook
      lazily, then filled round and full with the gentle, steady wind. Mr.
      Lawrence Newt laughed as he watched, for he thought of fine ladies taking
      their hair out of curl-papers, and patting and smoothing and rolling it
      upon little sticks and over little fingers until the curls stood round and
      full, and ready for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the ship moved slowly, almost imperceptibly, from the wharf&mdash;so
      slowly, so imperceptibly, that the people on board thought the city was
      sliding away from them. The merchant saw the solid, trim, beautiful vessel
      turn her bow southward and outward, and glide gently down the river. Her
      hull was soon lost to his eyes, but he could see the streamer fluttering
      at the mast-head over the masts of the other vessels. While he looked it
      vanished&mdash;the ship was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often enough Mr. Lawrence Newt stood leaning his head against the
      window-frame of his office after the ship had disappeared, and seemed to
      be looking at the ferry-boats or at the lofty city of Brooklyn. But he saw
      neither. Faster than ship ever sailed, or wind blew, or light flashed, the
      thought of Lawrence Newt darted, and the merchant, seemingly leaning
      against his office-window in South Street, was really sitting under
      palm-trees, or dandling in a palanquin, or chatting in a strange tongue,
      or gazing in awe upon snowier summits than the villagers of Chamouni have
      ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was that dark little hand he seemed to himself to press?&mdash;and
      what were those eyes, soft depths of exquisite darkness, into which
      through his own eyes his soul seemed to be sinking?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were clerks busily writing in the outer office. It was dark in that
      office when Mr. Newt first occupied the rooms, and Thomas Tray, the
      book-keeper, who had the lightest place, said that the eyes of Venables,
      the youngest clerk, were giving out. Young Venables, a lad of sixteen,
      supported a mother and sister and infirm father upon his five hundred
      dollars a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eyes giving out in my service, Thomas Tray! I am ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lawrence Newt hired the adjoining office, knocked down all the walls,
      and introduced so much daylight that it shone not only into the eyes of
      young Venables, but into those of his mother and sister and infirm father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was scratch, scratch, scratch, all day long in the clerks&rsquo;
      office. Messengers were coming and going. Samples were brought in. Draymen
      came for orders. Apple-women and pie-men dropped in about noon, and there
      were plenty of cheap apples and cheap jokes when the peddlers were young
      and pretty. Customers came and brother merchants, who went into Mr.
      Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s room. They talked China news, and South American
      news, and Mediterranean news. Their conversation was full of the names of
      places of which poems and histories have been written. The merchants joked
      complacent jokes. They gossiped a little when business had been discussed.
      So young Whitloe was really to marry Magot&rsquo;s daughter, and the
      Doolittle money would go to the Magots after all! And old Jacob Van
      Boozenberg had actually left off knee-breeches and white cravats, and none
      of his directors knew him when he came into the Bank in modern costume.
      And there was no doubt that Mrs. Dagon wore cotton lace at the Orrys&rsquo;,
      for Winslow&rsquo;s wife said she saw it with her own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s talk ceased with that about business. When the
      scandal set in, his mind seemed to set out. He stirred the fire if it were
      winter. He stepped into the outer office. He had a word for Venables. Had
      Miss Venables seen the new novel by Mr. Bulwer? It is called &ldquo;Pelham,&rdquo;
      and will be amusing to read aloud in the family. Will Mr. Venables call at
      Carville&rsquo;s on his way up, have the book charged to Mr. Lawrence
      Newt, and present it, with Mr. Newt&rsquo;s compliments, to his sister? If
      it were summer he opened the window, when it happened to be closed, and
      stood by it, or drew his chair to it and looked at the ships and the
      streets, and listened to the sailors swearing when he might have heard
      merchants, worth two or three hundred thousand dollars apiece, talking
      about Mrs. Dagon&rsquo;s cotton lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he sat at his table writing letters. He was alone in the inner
      room; but the sun that morning did not see a row of pleasanter faces than
      were bending over large books in odoriferous red Russia binding, and
      little books in leather covers, and invoices and sheets of letter paper,
      in the outer office of Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lad entered the office and stood at the door, impressed by the silent
      activity he beheld. He did not speak; the younger clerks looked up a
      moment, then went on with their work. It was clearly packet-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad remained silent for so long a time, as if his profound respect for
      the industry he saw before him would not allow him to speak, that Thomas
      Tray looked up at last, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see Mr. Newt, Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the other room,&rdquo; said Mr. Tray, with his goose-quill in
      his mouth, nodding his head toward the inner office, and turning over with
      both hands a solid mass of leaves in his great, odoriferous red Russia
      book, and letting them gently down&mdash;proud of being the author of that
      clearly-written, massive work, containing an accurate biography of
      Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth tapped at the glass door. Mr. Newt said, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo;
      and, when the door opened, looked up, and still holding his pen with the
      ink in it poised above the paper, he said, kindly, &ldquo;Well, Sir? Be
      short. It&rsquo;s packet-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a place, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a store, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m all full. But sit down while I finish
      these letters; then we&rsquo;ll talk about it.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; A SCHOOL-BOY NO LONGER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The lad seated himself by the window. Scratch&mdash;scratch&mdash;scratch.
      The sun sparkled in the river. The sails, after yesterday&rsquo;s rain,
      were loosened to dry, and were white as if it had rained milk upon them
      instead of water. Every thing looked cheerful and bright from Lawrence
      Newt&rsquo;s window. The lad saw with delight how much sunshine there was
      in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it would hurt my health to work here,&rdquo;
      thought he. Mr. Lawrence Newt rang a little bell. Venables entered
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most ready out there?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most ready, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brisk&rsquo;s the word this morning, you know. Please to copy these
      letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Venables said nothing, took the letters, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, young man,&rdquo; said the merchant, &ldquo;tell me what you
      want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad&rsquo;s heart turned toward him like a fallow-field to the May
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s been unfortunate, Sir, and I want to do something
      for myself. He advised me to come to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he said you would give me good advice if you couldn&rsquo;t
      give me employment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, you seem a strong, likely lad. Have you ever been in a
      store?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir. I left school last week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s been unfortunate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? Has he told a lie, or lost his eyes, or his
      health, or has his daughter married a drunkard?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lawrence
      Newt, looking at the lad with a kindly humor in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Sir,&rdquo; replied the boy, surprised. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      lost his money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ho! his money! And it is the loss of money which you call
      'unfortunate.&rsquo; Now, my boy, think a moment. Is there any thing
      belonging to your father which he could so well spare? Has he any
      superfluous boy or girl? any useless arm or leg? any unnecessary good
      temper or honesty? any taste for books, or pictures, or the country, that
      he would part with? Is there any thing which he owns that it would not be
      a greater misfortune to him to lose than his money? Honor bright, my boy.
      If you think there is, say so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, I suppose worse things could happen to us than poverty,&rdquo;
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lawrence Newt interrupted him by remarks which were belied by his
      beaming face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse things than poverty! Why, my boy, what are you thinking of?
      Do you not know that it is written in the largest efforts upon the hearts
      of all Americans, &lsquo;Resist poverty, and it will flee from you?&rsquo;
      If you do not begin by considering poverty the root of all evil, where on
      earth do you expect to end? Cease to be poor, learn to be rich. I&rsquo;m
      afraid you don&rsquo;t read the good book. So your father has health&rdquo;&mdash;the
      boy nodded&mdash;&ldquo;and a whole body, a good temper, an affectionate
      family, generous and refined tastes, pleasant relations with others, a
      warm heart, a clear conscience&rdquo;&mdash;the boy nodded with an
      increasing enthusiasm of assent&mdash;&ldquo;and yet you call him
      unfortunate&mdash;ruined! Why, look here, my son; there&rsquo;s an old
      apple-woman at the corner of Burling Slip, where I stop every day and buy
      apples; she&rsquo;s sixty years old, and through thick and thin, under a
      dripping wreck of an umbrella when it rains, under the sky when it shines&mdash;warming
      herself by a foot-stove in winter, by the sun in summer&mdash;there the
      old creature sits. She has an old, sick, querulous husband at home, who
      tries to beat her. Her daughters are all out at service&mdash;let us hope,
      in kind families&mdash;her sons are dull, ignorant men; her home is
      solitary and forlorn; she can not read much, nor does she want to; she is
      coughing her life away, and succeeds in selling apples enough to pay her
      rent and buy food for her old man and herself. She told me yesterday that
      she was a most fortunate woman. What does the word mean? I give it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad looked around the spacious office, on every table and desk and
      chair of which was written Prosperity as plainly as the name of Lawrence
      Newt upon the little tin sign by the door. Except for the singular
      magnetism of the merchant&rsquo;s presence, which dissipated such a
      suggestion as rapidly as it rose, the youth would have said aloud what was
      in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How easy &lsquo;tis for a rich man to smile at poverty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man watched the boy, and knew exactly what he was thinking. As the
      eyes of the younger involuntarily glanced about the office and presently
      returned to the merchant, they found the merchant&rsquo;s gazing so keenly
      that they seemed to be mere windows through which his soul was looking.
      But the keen earnestness melted imperceptibly into the usual sweetness as
      Lawrence Newt said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I can talk prettily about misfortune because I know
      nothing about it. You make a great mistake. No man, even in jest, can talk
      well of what he doesn&rsquo;t understand. So don&rsquo;t misunderstand me.
      I am rich, but I am not fortunate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it in the same tone as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wanted a rose and got only a butter-cup, should you think
      yourself fortunate?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Sir. A man can&rsquo;t expect to have every thing
      precisely as he wants it,&rdquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend, you are of opinion that a half loaf is better than
      no bread. True&mdash;so am I. But never make the mistake of supposing a
      half to be the whole. Content is a good thing. When the man sent for cake,
      and said, &lsquo;John, if you can&rsquo;t get cake, get smelts,&rsquo; he
      did wisely. But smelts are not cake for all that. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
      asked Mr. Newt, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel Bennet,&rdquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bennet&mdash;Bennet&mdash;what Bennet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was apparently satisfied with this answer. He only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my son, you do wisely to say at once you don&rsquo;t know,
      instead of going back to somebody a few centuries ago, of whose father you
      have to make the same answer. The Newts, however, you must be aware, are a
      very old family.&rdquo; The merchant smiled. &ldquo;They came into England
      with the Normans; but who they came into Normandy with I don&rsquo;t know.
      Do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel laughed, with a pleasant feeling of confidence in his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been at school in the city?&rdquo; asked the merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel told him that he had been at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ho! then you know my nephew Abel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; replied Gabriel, coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel is a smart boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like Abel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel paused a moment; then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant looked at the boy for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did you like at school?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I liked Jim Greenidge and Little Malacca best,&rdquo;, replied
      Gabriel, as if the whole world must be familiar with those names.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of the latter Lawrence Newt looked interested, and, after
      talking a little more, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel, I take you into my office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He called Mr. Tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas Tray, this is the youngest clerk, Gabriel Bennet. Gabriel,
      this is the head of the outer office, Mr. Thomas Tray. Thomas, ask
      Venables to step this way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That young man appeared immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Venables, you are promoted. You have seven hundred dollars a
      year, and are no longer youngest clerk. Gabriel Bennet, this is Frank
      Venables. Be friends. Now go to work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general bowing, and Thomas Tray and the two young men retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went out Mr. Newt opened a letter which had been brought in from
      the Post during the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR,&mdash;I trust you will pardon this intrusion. It is a
      long time since I have had the honor of writing to you; but I thought you
      would wish to know that Miss Wayne will be in New York, for the first
      time, within a day or two after you receive this letter. She is with her
      aunt, Mrs. Dinks, who will stay at Bunker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respectfully yours,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;JANE SIMCOE.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s head drooped as he sat. Presently he arose and
      walked up and down the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Gabriel was installed. That ceremony consisted of offering him a
      high stool with a leathern seat. Mr. Tray remarked that he should have a
      drawer in the high desk, on both sides of which the clerks were seated.
      The installation was completed by Mr. Tray&rsquo;s formally introducing
      the new-comer to the older clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scratching began again. Gabriel looked curiously upon the work in
      which he was now to share. The young men had no words for him. Mr. Newt
      was engaged within. The boy had a vague feeling that he must shift for
      himself&mdash;that every body was busy&mdash;that play in this life had
      ended and work begun. The thought tasted to him much more like smelts than
      cake. And while he was wisely left by Thomas Tray to familiarize himself
      with the entire novelty of the situation his mind flashed back to
      Delafield with an aching longing, and the boy would willingly have put his
      face in his hands and wept. But he sat quietly looking at his companions&mdash;until
      Mr. Tray said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel, I want you to copy this invoice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gabriel was a school-boy no longer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; PHILOSOPHY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abel Newt believed in his lucky star. He had managed Uncle Savory&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      he manage the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Mr. Boniface Newt, &ldquo;you are now about to
      begin the world.&rdquo; (Begin? thought Abel.) &ldquo;You are now coming
      into my house as a merchant. In this world we must do the best we can. It
      is a great pity that men are not considerate, and all that. But they are
      not. They are selfish. You must take them as you find them. <i>You</i>, my
      son, think they are all honest and good.&rdquo;&mdash;Do I? quoth son, in
      his soul.&mdash;&ldquo;It is the bitter task of experience to undeceive
      youth from its romantic dreams. As a rule, Abel, men are rascals; that is
      to say, they pursue their own interests. How sad! True; how sad! Where was
      I? Oh! men are scamps&mdash;with some exceptions; but you must go by the
      rule. Life is a scrub-race&mdash;melancholy, Abel, but true. I talk
      plainly to you, but I do it for your good. If we were all angels, things
      would be different. If this were the Millennium, every thing would
      doubtless be agreeable to every body. But it is not&mdash;how very sad!
      True, how very sad! Where was I? Oh! it&rsquo;s all devil take the
      hindmost. And because your neighbors are dishonest, why should you starve?
      You see, Abel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Mr. Boniface Newt&rsquo;s counting-room that he preached this
      gospel. A boy entered and announced that Mr. Hadley was outside looking at
      some cases of dry goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Abel,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return in a
      moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped out, smiling and rubbing his hands. Mr. Hadley was stooping
      over a case of calicoes; Blackstone, Hadley, &amp; Merrimack&mdash;no
      safer purchasers in the world. The countenance of Boniface Newt beamed
      upon the customer as if he saw good notes at six months exuding from every
      part of his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Hadley. Charming morning, Sir&mdash;beautiful
      day, Sir. What&rsquo;s the word this morning, Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; returned the customer. &ldquo;Pretty print
      that. Just what I&rsquo;ve been looking for&rdquo; (renewed rubbing of
      hands on the part of Mr. Newt)&mdash;&ldquo;very pretty. If it&rsquo;s the
      right width, it&rsquo;s just the thing. Let me see&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      about seven-eighths.&rdquo; He shook his head negatively. &ldquo;No, not
      wide enough. If that print were a yard wide, I should take all you have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a yard,&rdquo; replied Mr. Newt; &ldquo;certainly
      a full yard.&rdquo; He looked around inquiringly, as if for a yard-stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the yard-stick?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hadley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timothy!&rdquo; said Mr. Newt to the boy, with a peculiar look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy disappeared and reappeared with a yard-stick, while Mr. Newt&rsquo;s
      face underwent a series of expressions of subdued anger and disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Hadley, laying the yard-stick upon the
      calicoes; &ldquo;yes, as I thought, seven-eighths; too narrow&mdash;sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were thirty cases of those goods in the loft. Boniface Newt groaned
      in soul. The unconscious small boy, who had not understood the peculiar
      look, and had brought the yard-stick, stood by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said Hadley, stopping at another case, &ldquo;that
      is very handsome.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, very; and that is the last case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no other cases?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well, send it round at once; for I am sure&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said the unconscious boy, smiling with the
      satisfaction of one who is able to correct an error, &ldquo;you are
      mistaken, Sir. There are a dozen more cases just like that up stairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then I don&rsquo;t care about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Hadley,
      passing on. The head of the large commission-house of Boniface Newt &amp;
      Co. looked upon the point of apoplexy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Newt; sorry that I see nothing farther,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Hadley, and he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt turned fiercely to the unconscious boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Sir, by saying and doing such things?&rdquo;
      asked he, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things, Sir?&rdquo; demanded the appalled boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, getting the yard-stick when I winked to you not to find it,
      and telling of other cases when I said that one was the last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir, because it wasn&rsquo;t the last,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For business purposes it <i>was</i> the last, Sir,&rdquo; replied
      Mr. Newt. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the first principles of business.
      The tongue is always the mischief-maker. Hold your tongue, Sir, hold your
      tongue, or you&rsquo;ll lose your place, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boniface Newt, ruffled and red, went into his office, where he found
      Abel reading the newspaper and smoking a cigar. The clerks outside were
      pale at the audacity, of Newt, Jun. The young man was dressed extremely
      well. He had improved the few weeks of his residence in the city by visits
      to Frost the tailor, in Maiden Lane; and had sent his measure to Forr, the
      bootmaker in Paris, artists who turned out the prettiest figures that
      decorated the Broadway of those days. Mr. Abel Newt, to his father&rsquo;s
      eyes, had the air of a man of superb leisure; and as he sat reading the
      paper, with one leg thrown over the arm of the office-chair, and the smoke
      languidly curling from his lips, Mr. Boniface Newt felt profoundly, but
      vaguely, uncomfortable, as if he had some slight prescience of a future of
      indolence for the hope of the house of Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his father entered, Mr. Abel dropped by his side the hand still holding
      the newspaper, and, without removing the cigar, said, through the cloud of
      smoke he blew,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you were imparting your philosophy of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The older gentleman, somewhat discomposed, answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was saying what a pity it is that men are such d&mdash;&mdash;d
      rascals, because they force every body else to be so too. But what can you
      do? It&rsquo;s all very fine to talk, but we&rsquo;ve got to live. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      be such an ass as to run into the street and say, &lsquo;I gave ten cents
      a yard for those goods, but you must pay me twenty.&rsquo; Not at all. It&rsquo;s
      other men&rsquo;s business to find that out if they can. It&rsquo;s a
      great game, business is, and the smartest chap wins. Every body knows we
      are going to get the largest price we can. People are gouging, and
      shinning, and sucking all round. It&rsquo;s give and take. I am not here
      to look out for other men, I&rsquo;m here to take care of myself&mdash;for
      nobody else will. It&rsquo;s very sad, I know; it&rsquo;s very sad,
      indeed. It&rsquo;s absolutely melancholy. Ah, yes! where was I? Oh! I was
      saying that a lie well stuck to is better than the truth wavering. It&rsquo;s
      perfectly dreadful, my son, from some points of view&mdash;Christianity,
      for instance. But what on earth are you going to do? The only happy people
      are the rich people, for they don&rsquo;t have this eternal bother how to
      make money. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me, my son; I do not say that you
      must always tell stories. Heaven forbid! But a man is not bound always to
      tell the whole truth. The very law itself says that no man need give
      evidence against himself. Besides, business is no worse than every other
      calling. Do you suppose a lawyer never defends a man whom he knows to be
      guilty? He says he does it to give the culprit a fair trial.
      Fiddle-de-dee! He strains every nerve to get the man off. A lawyer is
      hired to take the side of a company or a corporation in every quarrel. He&rsquo;s
      paid by the year or by the case. He probably stops to consider whether his
      company is right, doesn&rsquo;t he? he works for justice, not for victory?
      Oh, yes! stuff! He works for fees. What&rsquo;s the meaning of a retainer?
      That if, upon examination, the lawyer finds the retaining party to be in
      the right, he will undertake the case? Fiddle! no! but that he will
      undertake the case any how and fight it through. So &lsquo;tis all round.
      I wish I was rich, and I&rsquo;d be out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boniface Newt discoursed warmly; Mr. Abel Newt listened with extreme
      coolness. He whiffed his cigar, and leaned his head on one side as he
      hearkened to the wisdom of experience; observing that his father put his
      practice into words and called it philosophy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; OF GIRLS AND FLOWERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Abel Newt was not a philosopher; he was a man of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told his mother that he could not accompany her to the Springs, because
      he must prepare himself to enter the counting-room of his father. But the
      evening before she left, Mrs. Newt gave a little party for Mrs. Plumer, of
      New Orleans. So Miss Grace, of whom his mother had written Abel, and who
      was just about leaving school, left school and entered society,
      simultaneously, by taking leave of Madame de Feuille and making her
      courtesy at Mrs. Boniface Newt&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Feuille&rsquo;s was a &ldquo;finishing&rdquo; school. An extreme
      polish was given to young ladies by Madame de Feuille. By her generous
      system they were fitted to be wives of men of even the largest fortune.
      There was not one of her pupils who would not have been equal to the
      addresses of a millionaire. It is the profound conviction of all who were
      familiar with that seminary that the pupils would not have shrunk from
      marrying a crown-prince, or any king in any country who confined himself
      to Christian wedlock with one wife, or even the son of an English duke&mdash;so
      perfect was the polish, so liberal the education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt&rsquo;s party was select. Mrs. Plumer, Miss Grace Plumer and the
      Magots, with Mellish Whitloe, of course; and Mrs. Osborne Moultrie, a
      lovely woman from Georgia, and her son Sligo, a slim, graceful gentleman,
      with fair hair and eyes; Dr. and Mrs. Lush, Rev. Dr. and Mrs. Maundy, who
      came only upon the express understanding that there was to be no dancing,
      and a few other agreeable people. It was a Summer party, Abel said&mdash;mere
      low-necked muslin, strawberries and ice-cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the strangers of the gentler sex soon discovered the dark,
      rich face of Abel, who moved among the groups with the grace and ease of
      an accomplished man of society, smiling brightly upon his friends, bowing
      gravely to those of his mother&rsquo;s guests whom he did not personally
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Whetwood Tully, who had recently
      returned with her daughter, one of Madame de Feuille&rsquo;s finest
      successes, from a foreign tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my brother Abel,&rdquo; replied Miss Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother Abel? how charming! How very like he is to Viscount
      Tattersalls. You&rsquo;ve not been in England, I believe, Miss Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny bowed negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then you have never seen Lord Tattersalls. He is a very
      superior young man. We were very intimate with him indeed. Dolly, dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember our particular friend Lord Viscount Tattersalls?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he a bishop?&rdquo; asked Miss Fanny Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law! no, my dear. He was a&mdash;he was a&mdash;why, he was a
      Viscount, you know&mdash;a Viscount.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a Viscount?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a Viscount.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! a Viscount.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dolly dear, do you see how much Mr. Abel Newt resembles Lord
      Tattersalls?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very striking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or now I look, I think he is even more like the Marquis of
      Crockford. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very like indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly, dear, don&rsquo;t you think his nose is like the Duke of
      Wellington&rsquo;s? You remember the Wellington nose, my child?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or is it Lord Brougham&rsquo;s that I mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I present my brother Abel, Miss Tally?&rdquo; asked Fanny Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Miss Tully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt turned just as a song began in the other room, out of which
      opened the conservatory.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Last May a braw wooer cam down the lang glen,
   And sair wi&rsquo; his love he did deave me:
I said there was naething I hated like men&mdash;
   The deuce gae wi&rsquo;m to believe&rsquo;me, believe me,
   The deuce gae wi&rsquo;m to believe me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The rooms were hushed as the merry song rang out. The voice of the singer
      was arch, and her eye flashed slyly on Abel Newt as she finished, and a
      murmur of pleasure rose around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel leaned upon the piano, with his eyes fixed upon the singer. He was
      fully conscious of the surprise he had betrayed to sister Fanny when she
      spoke suddenly of Mrs. Alfred Dinks. It was necessary to remove any
      suspicion that she might entertain in consequence. If Mr. Abel Newt had
      intentions in which Miss Hope Wayne was interested, was there any reason
      why Miss Fanny Newt should mingle in the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      As Miss Plumer finished the song Abel saw his sister coming toward him
      through the little crowd, although his eyes seemed to be constantly fixed
      upon the singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; said he, ardently, in a low voice, looking
      Grace Plumer directly in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a pretty song.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you mean the song?&rdquo; said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singer blushed, and took up a bunch of roses that she had laid upon
      the piano and began to play with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very warm it is!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Abel. &ldquo;Let us take a turn in the
      conservatory&mdash;it is both darker and cooler; and I think your eyes
      will give light and warmth enough to our conversation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! if you depend upon me it will be the Arctic zone in the
      conservatory,&rdquo; said Miss Grace Plumer, as she rose from the piano.
      (Mrs. Newt had written Abel she was fourteen! She was seventeen in May.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;we shall find the tropics in that
      conservatory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then look out for storms!&rdquo; replied Miss Plumer, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel offered his arm, and the young couple moved through the humming room.
      The arch eyes were cast down. The voice of the youth was very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a touch, and turned. He knew very well who it was. It was his
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, I want to present you to Miss Whetwood Tully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny, I can not turn from roses to violets. Miss Tully, I
      am sure, is charming. I would go with you with all my heart if I could,&rdquo;
      said he, smiling and looking at Miss Plumer; &ldquo;but, you see, all my
      heart is going here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace Plumer blushed again. He was certainly a charming young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt, with lips parted, looked at him a moment and shook her head
      gently. Abel was sure she would happen to find herself in the conservatory
      presently, whither he and his companion slowly passed. It was prettily
      illuminated with a few candles, but was left purposely dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely it is here! Oh! how fond I am of flowers!&rdquo; said
      Miss Plumer, with the prettiest little rapture, and such a little spring
      that Abel was obliged to hold her arm more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of flowers, Mr. Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I prefer them living.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living flowers&mdash;what a poetic idea! But what do you mean?&rdquo;
      asked Grace Plumer, hanging her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel saw somebody on the cane sofa under the great orange-tree, almost
      hidden in the shade. Dear Fanny! thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Grace,&rdquo; began Abel, in his lowest, sweetest voice;
      but the conservatory was so still that the words could have been easily
      heard by any one sitting upon the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one was sitting there&mdash;some one did hear. Abel smiled in his
      heart, and bent more closely to his companion. His manner was full of
      tender devotion. He and Grace came nearer. Some one not only heard, but
      started. Abel raised his eyes smilingly to meet Fanny&rsquo;s. Somebody
      else started then; for under the great orange-tree, on the cane sofa, sat
      Lawrence Newt and Hope Wayne.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; OLD FRIENDS AND NEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt had called at Bunker&rsquo;s, and found Mrs. Dinks and Miss
      Hope Wayne. They were sitting at the window upon Broadway watching the
      promenaders along that famous thoroughfare; for thirty years ago the
      fashionable walk was between the Park and the Battery, and Bunker&rsquo;s
      was close to Morris Street, a little above the Bowling Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Newt was announced Hope Wayne felt as if she were suffocating.
      She knew but one person of that name. Her aunt supposed it to be the
      husband of her friend, Mrs. Nancy Newt, whom she had seen upon a previous
      visit to New York this same summer. They both looked up and saw a
      gentleman they had never seen before. He bowed pleasantly, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies, my name is Lawrence Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a touch of quaintness in his manner, as in his dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find the city quite deserted,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I
      have called with an invitation from my sister, Mrs. Boniface Newt, for
      this evening to a small party. She incloses her card, and begs you to
      waive the formality of a call.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the way that Lawrence Newt and Hope Wayne came to be sitting on
      the cane sofa under the great orange-tree in Boniface Newt&rsquo;s
      conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had entered the room and made their bows to Mrs. Nancy; and Mr.
      Lawrence, wishing to talk to Miss Hope, had led her by another way to the
      conservatory, and so Mr. Abel had failed to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sat under the tree Lawrence Newt conversed with Hope in a tone of
      earnest and respectful tenderness that touched her heart. She could not
      understand the winning kindliness of his manner, nor could she resist it.
      He spoke of her home with an accuracy of detail that surprised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not the same house in my day, and you, perhaps, hardly
      remember much of the old one. The house is changed, but nothing else; no,
      nothing else,&rdquo; he added, musingly, and with the same dreamy
      expression in his eyes that was in them when he leaned against his office
      window and watched the ships&mdash;while his mind sailed swifter and
      farther than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can not touch the waving outline of the hills that you see
      from the lawn, nor the pine-trees that shade the windows. Does the little
      brook still flow in the meadow below? And do you understand the
      pine-trees? Do they tell any tales?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked it with a half-mournful gayety. He asked as if he both longed and
      feared that she should say, &ldquo;Yes, they have told me: I know all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmurs of the singing came floating out to them as they sat. Hope was
      happy and trustful. She was in the house of Abel&mdash;she should see him&mdash;she
      should hear him! And this dear gentleman&mdash;not exactly like a father
      nor an uncle&mdash;well, yes, perhaps a young uncle&mdash;he is brother of
      Abel&rsquo;s mother, and he mysteriously knows so much about Pinewood, and
      his smiling voice has a tear in it as he speaks of old days. I love him
      already&mdash;I trust him entirely&mdash;I have found a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go in again?&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt. But they saw some
      one approaching, and before they arose, while they were still silent, and
      Hope&rsquo;s heart was like the dawning summer heaven, she suddenly heard
      Abel Newt&rsquo;s words, and watched him, speechlessly, as he and his
      companion glided by her into the darkness. It was the vision of a moment;
      but in the attitude, the tone, the whole impression, Hope Wayne
      instinctively felt treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let us go in!&rdquo; she said to Lawrence Newt, as she rose
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel had passed. He could no more have stopped and shaken hands with Hope
      Wayne than he could have sung like a nightingale. He could not even raise
      his head erect as he went by&mdash;something very stern and very strong
      seemed to hold it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Plumer&rsquo;s head was also bent; she was waiting to hear the end of
      that sentence. She thought society opened beautifully. Such a handsome
      fellow in such a romantic spot, beginning his compliments in such a low,
      rich voice, with his hair almost brushing hers. But he did not finish.
      Abel Newt was perfectly silent. He glided away with Grace Plumer into
      grateful gloom, and her ears, exquisitely apprehensive, caught from his
      lips not a word further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt rose as Hope requested, and they moved away. She found her
      aunt, and stood by her side. The young men were brought up and presented,
      and submitted their observations upon the weather, asked her how she liked
      New York&mdash;were delighted to hear that she would pass the next winter
      in the city&mdash;would show her then that New York had some claim to
      attention even from a Bostonian&mdash;were charmed, really, with Mr.
      Bowdoin Beacon and&mdash;and&mdash;Mr. Alfred Dinks; at mention of which
      name they looked in her face in the most gentlemanly manner to see the red
      result, as if the remark had been a blister, but they saw only an
      unconscious abstraction in her own thoughts, mingled with an air of
      attention to what they were saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hope,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, who approached her with a
      young woman by his side, &ldquo;I want you to know my friend Amy Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls looked at each other and bowed. Then they shook hands with a
      curious cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring had dark eyes&mdash;not round and hard and black&mdash;not
      ebony eyes, but soft, sympathetic eyes, in which you expect to see images
      as lovely as the Eastern traveler sees when he remembers home and looks in
      the drop held in the palm of the hand of the magician&rsquo;s boy. They
      had the fresh, unworn, moist light of flowers early in June mornings, when
      they are full of sun and dew. And there was the same transparent, rich,
      pure darkness in her complexion. It was not swarthy, nor black, nor
      gloomy. It did not look half Indian, nor even olive. It was an illuminated
      shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls&mdash;they were women, rather&mdash;went together to a sofa
      and sat down. Hope Wayne&rsquo;s impulse was to lay her head upon her new
      friend&rsquo;s shoulder and cry; for Hope was prostrated by the unexpected
      vision of Abel, as a strong man is unnerved by sudden physical pain. She
      felt the overwhelming grief of a child, and longed to give way to it
      utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to know you, Miss Wayne!&rdquo; said Amy Waring, in a
      cordial, cheerful voice, with a pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope bowed, and thanked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find that Mr. Newt&rsquo;s friends always prove to be mine,&rdquo;
      continued Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it; but I don&rsquo;t know why I am his friend,&rdquo;
      said Hope. &ldquo;I never saw him until to-day. He must have lived in
      Delafield. Do you know how that is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She found conversation a great relief, and longed to give way to a kind of
      proud, indignant volubility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he seems to have lived every where, to have seen every
      thing, and to have known every body. A very useful acquaintance, I assure
      you!&rdquo; said Amy, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo; asked Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the least little blush upon Amy&rsquo;s cheek as she heard this
      question; but so slight, that if any body had thought he observed it, he
      would have looked again and said, &ldquo;No, I was mistaken,&rdquo;
      Perhaps, too, there was the least little fluttering of a heart otherwise
      unconscious. But words are like breezes that blow hither and thither, and
      the leaves upon the most secluded trees in the very inmost covert of the
      wood may sometimes feel a breath, and stir with responsive music before
      they are aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring replied, pleasantly, that he was not married. Hope Wayne said,
      &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; Amy smiled, and asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a pity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because such a man would be so happy if he were married, and would
      make others so happy! He has been in love, you may be sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Amy; &ldquo;I have no doubt of that. We don&rsquo;t
      see men of forty, or so, who have not been touched&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what?&rdquo; asked Lawrence Newt, who had come up silently, and
      now stood beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by what?&rdquo; interposed Miss Fanny, who had been very busy
      during the whole evening, trying to get into her hands the threads of the
      various interests that she saw flying and streaming all around her. She
      had seen Mr. Alfred Dinks devoted to Miss Wayne, and was therefore
      confirmed in her belief that they were engaged. She had seen Abel flirting
      with Grace, and was therefore satisfied that he cared nothing about her.
      She had done the best she could with Alfred Dinks, but was extremely
      dissatisfied with her best; and, seeing Hope and Amy together, she had
      been hovering about them for a long time, anxious to overhear or to join
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Amy, looking up with a smile, &ldquo;I was
      making a very innocent remark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly innocent, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; replied Fanny, in her
      sweetest manner. It was such a different sweetness from Amy Waring&rsquo;s,
      that Hope turned and looked very curiously at Miss Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are few men of forty who have not been in love,&rdquo; said
      Amy, calmly. &ldquo;That is what I was saying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was only one man of forty, or near that age, in the little group,
      the appeal was evidently to him. Lawrence Newt looked at the three girls,
      with the swimming light in his eyes, half crushing them and smiling, so
      that every one of them felt, each in her own way, that they were as
      completely blinded by that smile as by a glare of sunlight&mdash;which
      also, like that smile, is warm, and not treacherous.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not see beyond the words, nor hope to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Amy is right, as usual,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Uncle Lawrence, tell us all about it!&rdquo; said Fanny, with
      a hard, black smile in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Lawrence was not in the slightest degree abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will speak to you in a parable.
      Remember, to <i>you</i>. There was a farmer whose neighbor built a curious
      tower upon his land. It was upon a hill, in a grove. The structure rose
      slowly, but public curiosity rose with fearful rapidity. The gossips
      gossiped about it in the public houses. Rumors of it stole up to the city,
      and down came reporters and special correspondents to describe it with an
      unctuous eloquence and picturesque splendor of style known only to them.
      The builder held his tongue, dear Fanny. The workmen speculated upon the
      subject, but their speculations were no more valuable than those of other
      people. They received private bribes to tell; and all the great newspapers
      announced that, at an enormous expense, they had secured the exclusive
      intelligence, and the exclusive intelligence was always wrong. The country
      was in commotion, dear Fanny, about a simple tower that a man was building
      upon his land. But the wonder of wonders, and the exasperation of
      exasperations, was, that the farmer whose estate adjoined never so much as
      spoke of the tower&mdash;was never known to have asked about it&mdash;and,
      indeed, it was not clear that he knew of the building of any tower within
      a hundred miles of him. Of course, my dearest Fanny, a self-respecting
      Public Sentiment could not stand that. It was insulting to the public,
      which manifested so profound an interest in the tower, that the immediate
      neighbor should preserve so strict a silence, and such a perfectly
      tranquil mind. There are but two theories possible in regard to that man,
      said the self-respecting Public Sentiment: he is either a fool or a knave&mdash;probably
      a little of each. In any case he must be dealt with. So Public Sentiment
      accosted the farmer, and asked him if he were not aware that a mysterious
      tower was going up close to him, and that the public curiosity was sadly
      exercised about it? He replied that he was blessed with tolerable
      eyesight, and had seen the tower from the very first stone upward. Tell
      us, then, all about it! shrieked Public Sentiment. Ask the builder, if you
      want to know, said the farmer. But he won&rsquo;t tell us, and we want you
      to tell us, because we know that you must have asked him. Now what, in the
      name of pity!&mdash;what is that tower for? I have never asked, replies
      the farmer. Never asked? shrieked Public Sentiment. Never, retorted
      Rusticus. And why, in the name of Heaven, have you never asked? cried the
      crowd. Because, said the farmer&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt looked at his auditors. &ldquo;Are you listening, dear
      Fanny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Lawrence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;because it&rsquo;s none of my business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt smiled; so did all the rest, including Fanny, who remarked
      that he might have told her in fewer words that she was impertinent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Fanny; but sometimes words help us to remember things. It is a
      great point gained when we have learned to hoe the potatoes in our own
      fields, and not vex our souls about our neighbor&rsquo;s towers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne was not in the least abstracted. She was nervously alive to
      every thing that was said and done; and listened with a smile to Lawrence
      Newt&rsquo;s parable, liking him more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general restless distraction that precedes the breaking up of a party
      had now set in. People were moving, and rustling, and breaking off the
      ends of conversation. They began to go. A few said good-evening, and had
      had such a charming time! The rest gradually followed, until there was a
      universal departure. Grace Plumer was leaning upon Sligo Moultrie&rsquo;s
      arm. But where was Abel?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne&rsquo;s eyes looked every where. But her only glimpse of him
      during the evening had been that glimmering, dreadful moment in the
      conservatory. There he had remained ever since. There he still stood
      gazing through the door into the drawing-room, seeing but not seen&mdash;his
      mind a wild whirl of thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; thought Abel, bitterly. He was steadily
      asking himself, &ldquo;Have&mdash;I&mdash;lost&mdash;Hope Wayne&mdash;before&mdash;I&mdash;had&mdash;won&mdash;her?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; DOG-DAYS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The great city roared, and steamed, and smoked. Along the hot, glaring
      streets by the river a few panting people hurried, clinging to the house
      wall for a thin strip of shade, too narrow even to cover their feet. All
      the windows of the stores were open, and within the offices, with a little
      thinking, a little turn of the pen, and a little tracing in ink, men were
      magically warding off impending disaster, or adding thousands to the
      thousands accumulated already&mdash;men, too, were writing without
      thinking, mechanically copying or posting, scribbling letters of form,
      with heads clear or heads aching, with hearts burning or cold; full of
      ambition and hope, or vaguely remembering country hill-sides and summer
      rambles&mdash;a day&rsquo;s fishing&mdash;a night&rsquo;s frolic&mdash;Sunday-school&mdash;singing-school,
      and the girl with the chip hat garlanded with sweet-brier; hearts longing
      and loving, regretting, hoping, and remembering, and all the while the
      faces above them calm and smooth, and the hands below them busily doing
      their part of the great work of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Wall Street there was restless running about. Men in white clothes and
      straw-hats darted in at doors, darted out of doors&mdash;carrying little
      books, and boxes, and bundles in their hands, nodding to each other as
      they passed, but all infected with the same fever; with brows
      half-wrinkled or tied up in hopeless seams of perplexity; with muttering
      pale lips, or lips round and red, and clearly the lips of clerks who had
      no great stakes at issue&mdash;a general rushing and hurrying as if every
      body were haunted by the fear of arriving too late every where, and losing
      all possible chances in every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within doors there were cool bank parlors and insurance offices, with long
      rows of comely clerks writing in those Russia red books which Thomas Tray
      loved&mdash;or wetting their fingers on little sponges in little glass
      dishes and counting whole fortunes in bank-notes&mdash;or perched high on
      office-stools eating apples&mdash;while Presidents and Directors, with
      shiny bald pates and bewigged heads, some heroically with permanent
      spectacles and others coyly and weakly with eye-glasses held in the hand,
      sat perusing the papers, telling the news, and gossiping about
      engagements, and marriages, and family rumors, and secrets with the air of
      practical men of the world, with no nonsense, no fanaticism, no fol-de-rol
      of any kind about them, but who profoundly believed the Burt theory that
      wives and daughters were a more sacred kind of property than sheep
      pastures, or even than the most satisfactory bond and mortgage.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked politics, these banking and insurance gentlemen, with vigor
      and warmth. &ldquo;What on earth does, this General Jackson mean, Sir? Is
      he going to lay the axe at the very roots of our national prosperity? What
      the deuce does a frontier soldier know about banking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked about Morgan who had been found in Lake Ontario; and the
      younger clerks took their turn at it, and furiously denied among
      themselves that Washington was a Mason. The younger clerks held every
      Mason responsible for the reported murder. Then they turned pale lest
      their neighbors were Masons, and might cause them to be found drowned off
      the Battery. The older men shook their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murders&mdash;did you speak of murders, Mr. Van Boozenberg? Why, this is a
      dreadful business in Salem! Old Mr. White murdered in his bed! The most
      awful thing on record. Terrible stories are told, Sir, about respectable
      people! It&rsquo;s getting to be dangerous to be rich. What are we coming
      to? What can you expect, Sir, with Fanny Wright disseminating her infidel
      sentiments, and the work-people buying <i>The Friend of Equal Human Rights</i>?
      Equal human fiddle-sticks, Mr. Van Boozenberg!
    </p>
    <p>
      To which remarks from the mouths of many Directors that eminent officer
      nodded his head, and looked so wise that it was very remarkable so many
      foolish transactions took place under his administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in all the streets of the great city, in all the lofty workshops and
      yards and factories, huge hammers smote and clashed, and men, naked to the
      waist, reeking in dingy interiors, bent like gnomes at their tasks, while
      saws creaked, wheels turned, planes and mallets, and chisels shoved and
      cut and struck; and down in damp cellars sallow ghastly men and women wove
      rag-carpets, and twisted baskets in the midst of litters of puny, pale
      children, with bleared eyes, and sore heads, and dirty faces, tumbling,
      playing, shouting, whimpering&mdash;scampering after the pigs that came
      rooting and nosing in the liquid filth that simmered and stank to heaven
      in the gutters at the top of the stairs; and the houses above the heads of
      the ghastly men and women were swarming rookeries, hot and close and bare,
      with window-panes broken, and hats, and coats, and rags stuffed in, and
      men with bloodshot eyes and desperate faces sitting dogged with their hats
      on, staring at nothing, or leaning on their ragged elbows on broken
      tables, scowling from between their dirty hands at the world and the
      future; while in higher rooms sat solitary girls in hard wooden chairs, a
      pile of straw covered with a rug in the corner, and a box to put a change
      of linen in, driving the needle silently and ceaselessly through shirts or
      coats or trowsers, stooping over in the foul air during the heat of the
      day, straining their eyes when the day darkened to save a candle, hearing
      the roar and the rush and the murmur far away, mingled in the distance, as
      if they were dead and buried in their graves, and dreaming a horrid dream
      until the resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only sometimes an acute withering pain, as if something or somebody were
      sewing the sewer and pierced her with a needle sharp and burning, made the
      room swim and the straw in the corner glimmer; and the girl dropped the
      work and closed her eyes&mdash;the cheeks were black and hollow beneath
      them&mdash;and she gasped and panted, and leaned back, while the roar went
      on, and the hot sun glared, and the neighboring church clock, striking the
      hour, seemed to beat on her heart as it smote relentlessly the girl&rsquo;s
      returning consciousness. Then she took up the work again, and the needle,
      with whose little point in pain and sickness and consuming solitude, in
      darkness, desolation, and flickering, fainting faith, she pricked back
      death and dishonor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At neighboring corners were the reefs upon which human health, hope, and
      happiness lay stranded, broken up and gone to pieces. Bloated faces
      glowered through the open doors&mdash;their humanity sunk away into mere
      bestiality. Human forms&mdash;men no longer&mdash;lay on benches, hung
      over chairs, babbled, maundered, shrieked or wept aloud; while women came
      in and took black bottles from under tattered shawls, and said nothing,
      but put down a piece of money; and the man behind the counter said
      nothing, but took the money and filled the bottles, which were hidden
      under the tattered shawl again, and the speechless phantoms glided out,
      guarding that little travesty of modesty even in that wild ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In shops beyond, yards of tape, and papers of pins, and boots and shoes
      and bread, and all the multitudinous things that are bought and sold every
      minute, were being done up in papers by complaisant, or surly, or
      conceited, or well-behaved clerks; and in all the large and little houses
      of the city, in all the spacious and narrow streets, there were women
      cooking, washing, sweeping, scouring, rubbing, lifting, carrying, sewing,
      reading, sleeping&mdash;tens and twenties and fifties and hundreds and
      thousands of men, women, and children. More than two hundred thousand of
      them were toiling, suffering, struggling, enjoying, dreaming, despairing
      on a summer day, doing their share of the world&rsquo;s work. The eye was
      full of the city&rsquo;s activity; the ear was tired with its noise; the
      heart was sick with the thought of it; the streets and houses swarmed with
      people, but the world was out of town. There was nobody at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mighty stream, of which men and women are the waves, that poured
      ceaselessly along its channels, friends met surprised&mdash;touched each
      other&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came in this morning&mdash;off to-night&mdash;droll it looks&mdash;nobody
      in town&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the tumultuous throng bore them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the Park Theatre is jammed to hear Mr. Forrest, who made
      his first appearance in Philadelphia nine or ten years ago, and is already
      a New York favorite. Contoit&rsquo;s garden flutters with the cool dresses
      of the promenaders, who move about between the arbors looking for friends
      and awaiting ices. The click of billiard balls is heard in the glittering
      café at the corner of Reade Street, and a gay company smokes and sips at
      the Washington Hotel. Life bursts from every door, from every window, but
      there is nobody in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than two hundred thousand men, women, and children go to their beds
      and wake up to the morrow, but there is nobody in town. Nobody in town,
      because Mrs. Boniface Newt &amp; Co. have gone to Saratoga&mdash;no
      cathedral left, because some plastering has tumbled off an upper stone&mdash;no
      forest left, because a few leaves have whirled away. Nobody in town,
      because Mrs. Boniface Newt &amp; Co. have gone to Saratoga, and are doing
      their part of the world&rsquo;s work there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alfred Dinks, Mr. Zephyr Wetherley, and Mr. Bowdoin Beacon, were
      slowly sauntering down Broadway, when, they were overtaken and passed by a
      young woman walking rapidly for so warm a morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an immense explosion of adjectives expressing surprise when the
      three young, gentlemen discovered that the young lady who was passing them
      was Miss Amy Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Waring!&rdquo; cried they, simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed and smiled. They lifted their hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You in town!&rdquo; said Mr. Beacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In town?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Town?&rdquo; murmured Mr. Wetherley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Town,&rdquo; said Miss Waring, with her eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you come from? I thought you were all at Saratoga,&rdquo;
      she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid there,&rdquo; said Mr. Beacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite stupid,&rdquo; echoed Mr. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Wetherley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid?&rdquo; asked the lady, this time making the interrogation
      in the antistrophe of the chant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wanted a little fun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little fun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fun,&rdquo; replied the gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going about my business,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business?&rdquo; murmured the youths, in order. Zephyr concluding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business!&rdquo; said Miss Amy, bursting into a little laugh, in
      which the listless, perfectly good-humored youths cheerfully joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful hot,&rdquo; said Mr. Beacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! horrid!&rdquo; said Mr. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Zephyr. And the gentlemen wiped their foreheads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming to Saratoga, Miss Waring?&rdquo; they asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, I think, but possibly,&rdquo; said she, and moved away,
      with her little basket; while the gentlemen, swearing at the heat, the
      dust, and the smells, sauntered on, asseverated that Amy Waring was an odd
      sort of girl; and finally went in to the Washington Hotel, where each
      lolled back in an armchair, with the white duck legs reposing in another&mdash;excepting
      Mr. Dinks, who poised his boots upon the window-sill that commanded
      Broadway; and so, comforted with a cigar in the mouth, and a glass of iced
      port-wine sangaree in the hand, the three young gentlemen labored through
      the hot hours until dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring walked quite as rapidly as the heat would permit. She crossed
      the Park, and, striking into Fulton Street, continued toward the river,
      but turned into Water Street. The old peach-women at the corners, sitting
      under huge cotton umbrellas, and parching in the heat, saw the lovely face
      going by, and marked the peculiarly earnest step, which the sitters in the
      streets, and consequent sharp students of faces and feet, easily enough
      recognized as the step of one who was bound upon some especial errand.
      Clerks looked idly at her from open shop doors, and from windows above;
      and when she entered the marine region of Water Street, the heavy stores
      and large houses, which here and there were covered with a dull grime, as
      if the squalor within had exuded through the dingy red bricks, seemed to
      glare at her unkindly, and sullenly ask why youth, and beauty, and cleanly
      modesty should insult with sweet contrast that sordid gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat only made it worse. Half-naked children played in the foul
      gutters with the pigs, which roamed freely at large, and comfortably at
      home in the purlieus of the docks and the quarter of poverty. Carts
      jostled by with hogsheads, and boxes, and bales; the red-faced carmen,
      furious with their horses, or smoking pipes whose odor did not sweeten the
      air, staring, with rude, curious eyes, at the lady making her way among
      the casks and bales upon the sidewalks. There was nothing that could
      possibly cheer the eye or ear, or heart or imagination, in any part of the
      street&mdash;not even the haggard faces, thin with want, rusty with
      exposure, and dull with drink, that listlessly looked down upon her from
      the windows of lodging-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of one of these was open, and Amy Waring went in. She passed
      rapidly through the desolate entry and up the dirty stairs with the broken
      railing&mdash;stairs that creaked under her light step. At a room upon the
      back of the house, in the third story, she stopped and tapped at the door.
      A voice cried, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; The girl answered, &ldquo;Amy,&rdquo;
      and the door was immediately unlocked.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; AUNT MARTHA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The room was clean. There was a rag carpet on the floor; a pine bureau
      neatly varnished; a half dozen plain but whole chairs; a bedstead, upon
      which the bedding was scrupulously neat; a pine table, upon which lay a
      much-thumbed leather-bound family Bible and a few religious books; and
      between the windows, over the bureau, hung a common engraving of Christ
      upon the Cross. The windows themselves looked upon the back of the stores
      on South Street. Upon the floor was a large basket full of work, with
      which the occupant of the room was evidently engaged. The whole room had
      an air of severity and cheerlessness, yet it was clear that every thing
      was most carefully arranged, and continually swept and washed and dusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person who had opened the door was a woman of nearly forty. She was
      dressed entirely in black. She had not so much as a single spot of white
      any where about her. She had even a black silk handkerchief twisted about
      her head in the way that negro women twine gay cloths; and such was her
      expression that it seemed as if her face, and her heart, and her soul, and
      all that she felt, or hoped, or remembered, or imagined, were clad and
      steeped in the same mourning garments and utter gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Amy,&rdquo; said she, in a hard and dry, but not
      unkind voice. In fact, the rigidity of her aspect, the hardness of her
      voice, and the singular blackness of her costume, seemed to be too
      monotonously uniform and resolute not to indicate something willful or
      unhealthy in the woman&rsquo;s condition, as if the whole had been rather
      superinduced than naturally developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Martha, I have brought you some things that I hope you will
      find comforting and agreeable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman glanced around the desolately regular and forbidding room,
      and sighed. The other took the basket and stepped to a closet, but paused
      as she opened it, and turning to Amy, said, in the same dry, hopeless
      manner,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This bounty is too good for a sinner; and yet it would be the
      unpardonable sin for so great a sinner to end her own life willfully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn woman put the contents of the basket into the closet; but it
      seemed as if, in that gloom, the sugar must have already lost its
      sweetness and the tea its flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy still glanced round the room, and her eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Aunt Martha, when may I tell?&rdquo; she asked, with piteous
      earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy, would you thwart God? He is too merciful already. I almost
      fear that to tolerate your sympathy and kindness is a sore offense in me.
      Think what a worm I am! How utterly foul and rank with sin!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with clasped hands lying before her in her lap, in the same hard
      tone as if the words were cut in ebony; with the same fixed lips&mdash;the
      same pale, unsmiling severity of face; above which the abundant hair,
      streaked with early gray, was almost entirely lost in the black
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely God is good!&rdquo; said Amy, tenderly and sadly.
      &ldquo;If we sin, He only asks us to repent and be forgiven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must pay the penalty, Amy,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;There
      is a price set upon every sin; and mine is so vast, so enormous&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, as if overwhelmed by the contemplation of it; then,
      in the same tone, she continued: &ldquo;You, Amy, can not even conceive
      how dreadful it is. You know what it is, but not how bad it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent again, and her soul appeared to wrap itself in denser
      gloom. The air of the room seemed to Amy stifling. The next moment she
      felt as if she were pierced with sharp spears of ice. She sprang up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall smother!&rdquo; said she; and opened the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Martha, I begin to feel that this is really wicked! If you
      only knew Lawrence Newt&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman raised one thin finger, without lifting the hand from her
      lap. Implacable darkness seemed to Amy to be settling upon her too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, aunt, let me have you moved to some less horrid place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foulness and filth are too sweet and fair for me,&rdquo; said the
      dark woman; &ldquo;and I have been too long idle already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the work and began to sew. Amy&rsquo;s heart ached as she
      looked at her, with sympathy for her suffering and a sense of inability to
      help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a violent knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Aunt Martha, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come; open this door, and let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going
      on!&rdquo; cried a loud, coarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it? Why, it&rsquo;s me&mdash;Joseph!&rdquo; replied the
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha rose and unlocked the door. A man whose face was like his
      voice bustled noisily into the room, with a cigar in his mouth and his hat
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come; where&rsquo;s that work? Time&rsquo;s up! Quick, quick!
      No time, no pay!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not quite done, Mr. Joseph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at Aunt Martha for a moment; then laughed in a jeering way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old lady Black, when you undertake to do a piece of work what d&rsquo;ye
      mean by not having it done? Damn it, there&rsquo;s a little too much of
      the lady about you! Show me that work!&rdquo; and he seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman brought the basket to him, in the bottom of which were several
      pieces completed and carefully folded. The man turned them over rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, in the devil&rsquo;s name, haven&rsquo;t you done the
      rest? Give &lsquo;em here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the whole, finished and unfinished, and, bundling them up, made
      for the door. &ldquo;No time, no pay, old lady; that&rsquo;s the rule.
      That&rsquo;s the only way to work such infernally jimmy old bodies as you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sewing woman remained perfectly passive as Mr. Joseph was passing out;
      but Amy sprang forward from the window:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Sir!&rdquo; said she, firmly. The man involuntarily turned,
      and such was his overwhelming surprise at seeing a lady suddenly standing
      before him, and a lady who spoke with perfect authority, that, with the
      instinct of obsequiousness instinctive in every man who depends upon the
      favor of customers, he took off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you take that work without paying for it you shall be made to
      pay,&rdquo; said Amy, quietly, her eyes flashing, and her figure firm and
      erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, ma&rsquo;am, oh certainly, ma&rsquo;am! Pay for it, of
      course, ma&rsquo;am! &lsquo;Twas only to frighten the woman, ma&rsquo;am;
      oh certainly, certainly&mdash;oh! yes, ma&rsquo;am, pay for it, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once,&rdquo; said Amy, without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, ma&rsquo;am; here&rsquo;s the money,&rdquo; and Mr.
      Joseph counted it out upon the pine table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better leave the rest to be done at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do so, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the man, putting down
      the bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remember that if you ever harm this woman by a word or look,
      even,&rdquo; added Amy, bending her head toward her aunt, &ldquo;you will
      repent it bitterly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at her and fumbled with his hat. The cigar had dropped upon
      the floor. Amy pointed to it, and said, &ldquo;Now go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Joseph stooped, picked up the stump, and departed. Amy felt weak. Her
      aunt stood by her, and said, calmly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only part of my punishment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy&rsquo;s eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, aunt; and if any body should break into your room and steal
      every thing you have and throw you out of the window, or break your bones
      and leave you here to die of starvation, I suppose you would think it all
      part of your punishment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be no more than I deserve, Amy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Martha,&rdquo; replied Amy, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t take
      care you will force me to break my promise to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy, to do that would be to bring needless disgrace upon your
      mother and all her family and friends. They have considered me dead for
      nearly sixteen years. They have long ago shed the last tear of regret for
      one whom they believed to be as pure as you are now. Why should you take
      her to them from the tomb, living still, but a loathsome mass of sin? I am
      equal to my destiny. The curse is great, but I will bear it alone; and the
      curse of God will fall upon you if you betray me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy was startled by the intensity with which these words were uttered.
      There was no movement of the hands or head upon the part of the older
      woman. She stood erect by the table, and, as her words grew stronger, the
      gloom of her appearance appeared to intensify itself, as a thunder-cloud
      grows imperceptibly blacker and blacker.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she stopped, Amy made no reply; but, troubled and uneasy, she drew a
      chair to the window and sat down. The older woman took up her work again.
      Amy was lost in thought, wondering what she could do. She saw nothing as
      she looked down into the dirty yards of the houses; but after some time,
      forgetting, in the abstraction of her meditation, where she was, she was
      suddenly aware of the movement of some white object; and looking curiously
      to see what it was, discovered Lawrence Newt gazing up at her from the
      back window of his store, and waving his handkerchief to attract her
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she saw the kindly face she smiled and shook her hand. There was a
      motion of inquiry: &ldquo;Shall I come round?&rdquo; And a very resolute
      telegraphing by the head back again: &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; There was
      another question, in the language of shoulders, and handkerchief, and
      hands: &ldquo;What on earth are you doing up there?&rdquo; The answer was
      prompt and intelligible: &ldquo;Nothing that I am ashamed of.&rdquo; Still
      there came another message of motion from below, which Amy, knowing
      Lawrence Newt, unconsciously interpreted to herself thus: &ldquo;I know
      you, angel of mercy! You have brought some angelic soup to some poor
      woman.&rdquo; The only reply was a smile that shone down from the window
      into the heart of the merchant who stood below. The smile was followed by
      a wave of the hand from above that said farewell. Lawrence Newt looked up
      and kissed his own, but the smiling face was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; THE CAMPAIGN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Fanny Newt went to Saratoga with a perfectly clear idea of what she
      intended to do. She intended to be engaged to Mr. Alfred Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      That young gentleman was a second cousin of Hope Wayne&rsquo;s, and his
      mother had never objected to his little visits at Pinewood, when both he
      and Hope were young, and when the unsophisticated human heart is flexible
      as melted wax, and receives impressions which only harden with time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the children play together, my dear,&rdquo; she said, in
      conjugal seclusion to her husband, the Hon. Budlong Dinks, who needed only
      sufficient capacity and a proper opportunity to have been one of the most
      distinguished of American diplomatists. He thought he was such already.
      There was, indeed, plenty of diplomacy in the family, and that most
      skillful of all diplomatic talents, the management of distinguished
      diplomatists, was not unknown there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt had made the proper inquiries. The result was that there were
      rumors&mdash;&ldquo;How <i>do</i> such stories start?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Budlong Dinks of all her friends who were likely to repeat the rumor&mdash;that
      it was a family understanding that Mr. Alfred Dinks and his cousin Hope
      were to make a match. &ldquo;And they <i>do</i> say,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Dinks, &ldquo;what ridiculous things people are! and they <i>do</i> say
      that, for family reasons, we are going to keep it all quiet! What a world
      it is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Mrs. Cod told Mrs. Dod, in a morning call, that Mrs. Budlong
      Dinks said that the engagement between her son Alfred and his cousin Hope
      Wayne was kept quiet for family reasons. Before sunset of that day society
      was keeping it quiet with the utmost diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These little stories were brought by little birds to New York, so that
      when Mrs. Dinks arrived the air was full of hints and suggestions, and the
      name of Hope Wayne was not unknown. Farther acquaintance with Mr. Alfred
      Dinks had revealed to Miss Fanny that there was a certain wealthy ancestor
      still living, in whom the Dinkses had an interest, and that the only
      participant with them in that interest was Miss Hope Wayne. That was
      enough for Miss Fanny, whose instinct at once assured her that Mrs. Dinks
      designed Hope Wayne for her son Alfred, in order that the fortune should
      be retained in the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fanny having settled this, and upon farther acquaintance with Mr.
      Dinks having discovered that she might as well undertake the matrimonial
      management of him as of any other man, and that the Burt fortune would
      probably descend, in part at least, to the youth Alfred, she decided that
      the youth Alfred must marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how should Hope Wayne be disposed of? Fanny reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lived in Delafield. Brother Abel, now nearly nineteen&mdash;not a
      childish youth&mdash;not unhandsome&mdash;not too modest&mdash;lived also
      in Delafield. Had he ever met Hope Wayne?
    </p>
    <p>
      By skillful correspondence, alluding to the solitude of the country, et
      cetera, and his natural wish for society, and what pleasant people were
      there in Delafield, Fanny had drawn her lines around Abel to carry the
      fact of his acquaintance, if possible, by pure strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply, Abel wrote about many things&mdash;about Mrs. Kingo and Miss
      Broadbraid&mdash;the Sutlers and Grabeaus&mdash;he praised the peaceful
      tone of rural society, and begged Fanny to beware of city dissipation; but
      not a word of old Burt and Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sister Fanny wrote again in the most confiding manner. Brother Abel
      replied in a letter of beautiful sentiments and a quotation from Dr.
      Peewee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He overdid it a little, as we sometimes do in this world. We appear so
      intensely unconscious that it is perfectly evident we know that somebody
      is looking at us. So Fanny, knowing that Christopher Burt was the richest
      man in the village, and lived in a beautiful place, and that his lovely
      grand-daughter lived with him constantly, with which information in detail
      Alfred Dinks supplied her, and perceiving from Abel&rsquo;s letter that he
      was not a recluse, but knew the society of the village, arrived very
      naturally and easily at the conclusion that brother Abel did know Hope
      Wayne, and was in love with her. She inferred the latter from the fact
      that she had long ago decided that brother Abel would not fall in love
      with any poor girl, and therefore she was sure that if he were in the
      immediate neighborhood of a lady at once young, beautiful, of good family
      and very rich, he would be immediately in love&mdash;very much in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make every thing sure, Abel had not been at home half an hour before
      Fanny&rsquo;s well-directed allusion to Hope as the future Mrs. Dinks had
      caused her brother to indicate an interest which revealed every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If now,&rdquo; pondered Miss Fanny, &ldquo;somebody who shall be
      nameless becomes Mrs. Alfred Dinks, and the nameless somebody&rsquo;s
      brother marries Miss Hope Wayne, what becomes of the Burt property?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She went, therefore, to Saratoga in great spirits, and with an unusual
      wardrobe. The opposing general, Field-marshal Mrs. Budlong Dinks, had
      certainly the advantage of position, for Hope Wayne was of her immediate
      party, and she could devise as many opportunities as she chose for
      bringing Mr. Alfred and his cousin together. She did not lose her chances.
      There were little parties for bowling in the morning, and early walking,
      and Fanny was invited very often, but sometimes omitted, as if to indicate
      that she was not an essential part of the composition. There was music in
      the parlor before dinner, and working of purses and bags before the
      dressing-bell. There was the dinner itself, and the promenade, with music,
      afterward. Drives, then, and riding; the glowing return at sunset&mdash;the
      cheerful cup of tea&mdash;the reappearance, in delightful toilet, for the
      evening dance&mdash;windows&mdash;balconies&mdash;piazzas&mdash;moonlight!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time that Fanny, warm with the dance, declared that she must have
      fresh air, and that was every time she danced with Alfred, she withdrew,
      attended by him, to the cool, dim piazza, and every time Mrs. Dinks beheld
      the departure. On the cool, dim piazza the music sounded more faintly, the
      quiet moonlight filled the air, and life seemed all romance and festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful after the hot room!&rdquo; Fanny said, one evening as
      they sat there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, how beautiful!&rdquo; replied Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy I feel!&rdquo; sighed Fanny. &ldquo;Ever since I have
      been here I have been so happy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been happy? So I have been happy too. How very funny!&rdquo;
      replied Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but pleasant too. Sympathy is always pleasant.&rdquo; And
      Fanny turned her large black eyes upon him, while the young Dinks was
      perplexed by a singular feeling of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were content to moralize upon sympathy for some time. Alfred was
      fascinated, and a little afraid. Fanny moved her Junonine shoulders, bent
      her swan-like neck, drew off one glove and played with her rings, fanned
      herself gently at intervals, and, with just enough embarrassment not to
      frighten her companion, opened and closed her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine fellow Bowdoin Beacon is!&rdquo; said Miss Fanny, a
      little suddenly, and in a tone of suppressed admiration, as she drew on
      her glove and laid her fan in her lap, as if on the point of departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a very good sort of fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cold you men always are in speaking of each other! I think him
      a splendid fellow. He&rsquo;s so handsome. He has such glorious dark hair&mdash;almost
      as dark as yours, Mr. Dinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred half raged, half smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; continued Fanny, looking down a little, and
      speaking a little lower&mdash;&ldquo;do you know if he has any particular
      favorites among the girls here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was dreadfully alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has, how happy they must be! I think him a magnificent sort
      of man; but not precisely the kind I should think a girl would fall in
      love with. Should you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Alfred, mollified and bewildered. He rallied in
      a moment. &ldquo;What sort of man do girls fall in love with, Miss Fanny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt was perfectly silent. She looked down upon the floor of the
      piazza, fixing her eyes upon a pine-knot, patiently waiting, and wondering
      which way the grain of the wood ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence continued. Every moment Alfred was conscious of an increasing
      nervousness. There were the Junonine shoulders&mdash;the neck&mdash;the
      downcast eyes&mdash;moonlight&mdash;the softened music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo; asked he, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny bent her head nearer to him, and dropped these words into his
      waistcoat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are! I am so happy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth have I done?&rdquo; was the perplexed, and pleased,
      and ridiculous reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dinks, how could I answer the question you asked without
      betraying&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Alfred, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without betraying what sort of man <i>I</i> love,&rdquo; breathed
      Fanny, in the lowest possible tone, which could be also perfectly
      distinct, and with her head apparently upon the point of dropping after
      her words into his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can not do that, but I will make a bargain with you. If you
      will say what sort of girl you would love, I will answer your question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny dreaded to hear a description of Hope Wayne. But Alfred&rsquo;s mind
      was resolved. The foolish youth answered with his heart in his mouth, and
      barely whispering,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will look in your glass to-night, you will see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Fanny&rsquo;s head had fallen into the waistcoat&mdash;Alfred
      Dinks&rsquo;s arms were embracing her. He perceived the perfume from her
      abundant hair. He was frightened, and excited, and pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Alfred!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Fanny!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come Hope, dear, it is very late,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dinks in the
      ball-room, alarmed at the long absence of Fanny and Alfred, and resolved
      to investigate the reason of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers heard the voice, and were sitting quietly just a little apart,
      as Mrs. Dinks and her retinue came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of taking cold, Miss Newt?&rdquo; inquired
      Alfred&rsquo;s mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh not at all, thank you, I am very warm. But you are very wise to
      go in, and I shall join you. Good-night, Mr. Dinks.&rdquo; As she rose,
      she whispered&mdash;&ldquo;After breakfast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies rustled along the piazza in the moonlight. Alfred, flushed and
      nervous and happy, sauntered into the bar-room, lit a cigar, and drank
      some brandy and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Honorable Budlong Dinks sat in an armchair at the other end
      of the piazza with several other honorable gentlemen&mdash;Major
      Scuppernong from Carolina, Colonel le Fay from Louisiana, Captain Lamb
      from Pennsylvania, General Arcularius Belch of New York, besides Captain
      Jones, General Smith, Major Brown, Colonel Johnson, from other States, and
      several honorable members of Congress, including, and chief of all, the
      Honorable B.J. Ele, a leading statesman from New York, with whom Mr. Dinks
      passed as much time as possible, and who was the chief oracle of the wise
      men in armchairs who came to the springs to drink the waters, to humor
      their wives and daughters in their foolish freaks for fashion and
      frivolity, and who smiled loftily upon the gay young people who amused
      themselves with setting up ten-pins and knocking them down, while the wise
      men devoted themselves to talking politics and showing each other, from
      day to day, the only way in which the country could be made great and
      glorious, and fulfill its destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so clear about General Jackson&rsquo;s policy,&rdquo; said
      the Honorable Budlong Dinks, with the cautious wisdom of a statesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, I am clear enough about it,&rdquo; replied Major
      Scuppernong. &ldquo;It will ruin this country just as sure as that,&rdquo;
      and the Major with great dexterity directed a stream of saliva which fell
      with unerring precision upon the small stone in the gravel walk at which
      it was evidently aimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Budlong Dinks watched the result of the illustration with
      deep interest, and shook his head gravely when he saw that the stone was
      thoroughly drenched by the salivary cascade. He seemed to feel the force
      of the argument. But he was not in a position to commit himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, <i>I</i> think,&rdquo; said the Honorable B.J. Ele, &ldquo;that
      it is the only thing that can save the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you do,&rdquo; said the Honorable B. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they kept it up day after day, pausing in the intervals to smile at
      the ardor with which the women played their foolish game of gossip and
      match-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Dinks withdrew from her idle employments to the invigorating air
      of the Honorable B.&lsquo;s society, he tapped her cheek sometimes with
      his finger&mdash;as he had read great men occasionally did when they were
      with their wives in moments of relaxation from intellectual toil&mdash;asked
      her what would become of the world if it were given up to women, and by
      his manner refreshed her consciousness of the honor under which she
      labored in being Mrs. Budlong Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weaker vessel smiled consciously, as if he very well knew that was the
      one particular thing which under no conceivable circumstances could she
      forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Budlong, I really think Alfred ought to keep a horse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; replied the Honorable B., in a tone of mingled
      reproach, amusement, contempt, and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know we can&rsquo;t afford it. But it would be so pleasant if
      he could drive out his cousin Hope, as so many of the other young men do.
      People get so well acquainted in that way. Have you observed that Bowdoin
      Beacon is a great deal with her? How glad Mrs. Beacon would be!&rdquo;
      Mrs. Dinks took off her cap, and was unpinning her collar, without in the
      least pressing her request. Not at all. His word was enough. She had
      evidently yielded the point. The horse was out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the state of the country did not so entirely engross her husband&rsquo;s
      mind, that he had not seen all the advantage of Hope&rsquo;s marrying
      Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> a pleasant thing for a young man to have his own
      horse. My dear, I will see what can be done,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the diplomatist untied his cravat as if he had been undoing the
      parchment of a great treaty. He fell asleep in the midst of rehearsing the
      speech which he meant to make upon occasion of his presentation as foreign
      minister somewhere; while his beloved partner lay by his side, and
      resolved that Alfred Dinks must immediately secure Hope Wayne before Fanny
      Newt secured Alfred Dinks.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; THE FINE ARTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The whole world of Saratoga congratulated Mrs. Dinks upon her beautiful
      niece, Miss Wayne. Even old Mrs. Dagon said to every body:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely she is! And to think she comes from Boston! Where did
      she get her style? Fanny dear, I saw you hugging&mdash;I beg your pardon,
      I mean waltzing with Mr. Dinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Hope Wayne danced there seemed to be nobody else moving. She
      filled the hall with grace, and the heart of the spectator with an
      indefinable longing. She carried strings of bouquets. She made men happy
      by asking them to hold some of her flowers while she danced; and then,
      when she returned to take them, the gentlemen were steeped in such a gush
      of sunny smiling that they stood bowing and grinning&mdash;even the wisest&mdash;but
      felt as if the soft gush pushed them back a little; for the beauty which,
      allured them defended her like a fiery halo.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was understood that she was engaged to Mr. Alfred Dinks, her cousin,
      who was already, or was to be, very rich. But there was apparently nothing
      very marked in his devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so much better taste for young people who are engaged not to
      make love in public,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dinks, as she sat in grand conclave
      of mammas and elderly ladies, who all understood her to mean her son and
      niece, and entirely agreed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile all the gentlemen who could find one of her moments disengaged
      were walking, bowling, driving, riding, chatting, sitting, with Miss
      Wayne. She smiled upon all, and sat apart in her smiling. Some foolish
      young fellows tried to flirt with her. When they had fully developed their
      intentions she smiled full in their faces, not insultingly nor familiarly,
      but with a soft superiority. The foolish young fellows went down to light
      their cigars and drink their brandy and water, feeling as if their faces
      had been rubbed upon an iceberg, for not less lofty and pure were their
      thoughts of her, and not less burning was their sense of her superb scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur Merlin, the painter, who had come to pass a few days at
      Saratoga on his way to Lake George, and whose few days had expanded into
      the few weeks that Miss Wayne had been there&mdash;Arthur Merlin, the
      painter, whose eyes were accustomed not only to look, but to see, observed
      that Miss Wayne was constantly doing something. It was dance, drive, bowl,
      ride, walk incessantly. From the earliest hour to the latest she was in
      the midst of people and excitement. She gave herself scarcely time to
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter was introduced to her, and became one of her habitual
      attendants. Every morning after breakfast Hope Wayne held a kind of court
      upon the piazza. All the young men surrounded her and worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin was intelligent and ingenuous. His imagination gave a kind
      of airy grace to his conversation and manner. Passionately interested in
      his art, he deserted its pursuit a little only when the observation of
      life around him seemed to him a study as interesting. He and Miss Wayne
      were sometimes alone together; but although she was conscious of a
      peculiar sympathy with his tastes and character, she avoided him more than
      any of the other young men. Mrs. Dagon said it was a pity Miss Wayne was
      so cold and haughty to the poor painter. She thought that people might be
      taught their places without cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin constantly said to himself in a friendly way that if he had
      been less in love with his art, or had not perceived that Miss Wayne had a
      continual reserved thought, he might have fallen in love with her. As it
      was, he liked her so much that he cared for the society of no other lady.
      He read Byron with her sometimes when they went in little parties to the
      lake, and somehow he and Hope found themselves alone under the trees in a
      secluded spot, and the book open in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also read to her one day a poem upon a cloud, so beautiful that Hope
      Wayne&rsquo;s cheek flushed, and she asked, eagerly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of Shelley&rsquo;s, a friend of Byron&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how different!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they were different men. Listen to this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the young man read the ode to a Sky-lark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How joyous it is!&rdquo; said Hope; &ldquo;but I feel the sadness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I often feel that in people as well as in poems,&rdquo;
      replied Arthur, looking at her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She colored a little&mdash;said that it was warm&mdash;and rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold black eyes of Miss Fanny Newt suddenly glittered upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go home with us, Miss Wayne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I am just coming;&rdquo; and Hope passed into the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Arthur Merlin was left alone he quietly lighted a cigar, opened his
      port-folio and spread it before him, then sharpened a pencil and began to
      sketch. But while he looked at the tree before him, and mechanically
      transferred it to the paper, he puffed and meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that Hope Wayne was constantly with other people, and yet he felt
      that she was a woman who would naturally like her own society. He also saw
      that there was no person then at Saratoga in whom she had such an interest
      that she would prefer him to her own society.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she was always seeking the distraction of other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was something that made the society of her own thoughts
      unpleasant&mdash;almost intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Arthur Merlin vigorously rubbed out with a piece of stale bread a
      false line he had drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is that something&mdash;or some-bod-y?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped sketching, and puffed for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he returned at sunset Hope Wayne was standing upon the piazza of the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been successful?&rdquo; asked she, dawning upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed her his sketch of a tree-stump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; but a little careless,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you draw, Miss Wayne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious light glimmered across her face, for she remembered where she
      had last heard those words. She shrank a little, almost imperceptibly, as
      if her eyes had been suddenly dazzled. Then a little more distantly&mdash;not
      much more, but Arthur had remarked every thing&mdash;she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I draw a little. Good-evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, please, Miss Wayne!&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur, as he saw that
      she was going. She turned and smiled&mdash;a smile that seemed to him like
      starlight, it was so clear and cool and dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have drawn this for you, Miss Wayne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent and took the sketch which he drew from his port-folio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Manfred in the Coliseum,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at it; but the smile faded entirely. Arthur stared at her in
      astonishment as the blood slowly ebbed from her cheeks, then streamed back
      again. The head of Manfred was the head of Abel Newt. Hope Wayne looked
      from the sketch to the artist, searching him with her eye to discover if
      he knew what he was doing. Arthur was sincerely unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne dropped the paper almost involuntarily. It floated into the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Merlin,&rdquo; said she, making a step to
      recover it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was before her, and handed it to her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said she, quietly, and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still twilight, and Arthur lighted a cigar and sat down to a
      meditation. The result of it was clear enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That head looks like somebody, and that somebody is Hope Wayne&rsquo;s
      secret.&rdquo; Puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did I get that head?&rdquo; He could not remember. &ldquo;Tut!&rdquo;
      cried he, suddenly bringing his chair down upon its legs with a force that
      knocked his cigar out of his mouth, &ldquo;I copied it from a head which
      Jim Greenidge has, and which he says was one of his school-fellows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Hope Wayne had carefully locked the door of her room. Then she
      hurriedly tore the sketch into the smallest possible pieces, laid them in
      her hand, opened the window, and whiffed them away into the dark.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; BONIFACE NEWT, SON, AND CO., DRY GOODS ON
      COMMISSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abel Newt smoked a great many cigars to enable him to see his position
      clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he told his mother that he could not accompany her to the Springs
      because he was about entering his father&rsquo;s counting-room, it was not
      so much because he was enamored of business as that his future relations
      with Hope were entirely doubtful, and he did not wish to complicate them
      by exposing himself to the chances of Saratoga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, of course, is the only career in this country, my son,&rdquo;
      said Boniface Newt. &ldquo;What men want, and women too, is money. What is
      this city of New York? A combination of men and machines for making money.
      Every body respects a rich man. They may laugh at him behind his back.
      They may sneer at his ignorance and awkwardness, and all that sort of
      thing, but they respect his money. Now there&rsquo;s old Jacob Van
      Boozenberg. I say to you in strict confidence, my son, that there was
      never a greater fool than that man. He absolutely knows nothing at all.
      When he dies he will be no more missed in this world than an old dead
      stage-horse who is made into a manure heap. He is coarse, and vulgar, and
      mean. His daughter Kate married his clerk, young Tom Witchet&mdash;not a
      cent, you know, but five hundred dollars salary. &lsquo;Twas against the
      old man&rsquo;s will, and he shut his door, and his purse, and his heart.
      He turned Witchet away; told his daughter that she might lie in the bed
      she had made for herself; told Witchet that he was a rotten young
      swindler, and that, as he had married his daughter for her money, he&rsquo;d
      be d&mdash;&mdash;d if he wouldn&rsquo;t be up with him, and deuce of a
      cent should they get from him. They live I don&rsquo;t know where, nor
      how. Some of her old friends send her money&mdash;actually give
      five-dollar bills to old Jacob Van Boozenberg&rsquo;s daughter, somewhere
      over by the North River. Every body knows it, you know; but, for all that,
      we have to make bows to old Van B. Don&rsquo;t we want accommodations?
      Look here, Abel; if Jacob were not worth a million of dollars, he would be
      of less consequence than the old fellow who sells apples at the corner of
      his bank. But as it is, we all agree that he is a shrewd, sensible old
      fellow; rough in some of his ways&mdash;full of little prejudices&mdash;rather
      sharp; and as for Mrs. Tom Witchet, why, if girls will run away, and all
      that sort of thing, they must take the consequences, you know. Of course
      they must. Where should we be if every rich merchant&rsquo;s daughters
      were at the mercy of his clerks? I&rsquo;m sorry for all this. It&rsquo;s
      sad, you know. It&rsquo;s positively melancholy. It troubles me. Ah, yes!
      where was I? Oh, I was saying that money is the respectable thing. And
      mark, Abel, if this were the Millennium, things would be very different.
      But it isn&rsquo;t the Millennium. It&rsquo;s give one and take two, if
      you can get it. That&rsquo;s what it is here; and let him who wants to,
      kick against the pricks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel hung his legs over the arms of the office-chairs in the
      counting-room, and listened gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose, Sir, that &lsquo;tis money <i>as</i> money
      that is worth having. It is only money as the representative of
      intelligence and refinement, of books, pictures, society&mdash;as a vast
      influence and means of charity; is it not, Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Mr. Abel Newt blew a prodigious cloud of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boniface Newt responded, &ldquo;Oh fiddle! that&rsquo;s all very fine.
      But my answer to that is Jacob Van Boozenberg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul! here he comes. Abel put your legs down! throw that
      cigar away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man came in. His clothes were snuffy and baggy&mdash;so was his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;, Mr. Newt. Beautiful mornin&rsquo;. I sez to ma
      this mornin&rsquo;, ma, sez I, I should like to go to the country to-day,
      sez I. Go &lsquo;long; pa! sez she. Werry well, sez I, I&rsquo;ll go
      &lsquo;long if you&rsquo;ll go too. Ma she laughed; she know&rsquo;d I
      wasn&rsquo;t in earnest. She know&rsquo;d &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t only a
      joke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Van Boozenberg drew out a large red bandana handkerchief, and blew his
      nose as if it had been a trumpet sounding a charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Newt &amp; Son smiled sympathetically. The junior partner
      observed, cheerfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The millionaire stared at the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;s going to Saratogy,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Van Boozenberg.
      &ldquo;She said she wanted to go. Werry well, sez I, ma, go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Newt &amp; Son smiled deferentially, and hoped Mrs. Van B. would
      enjoy herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t no fear of that,&rdquo; replied the millionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Van Boozenberg,&rdquo; said Boniface Newt, half-hesitatingly,
      &ldquo;you were very kind to undertake that little favor&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I come in to say I done that as you wanted. It&rsquo;s all
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Mr. Van Boozenberg, I am pleased to introduce to you my son
      Abel, who has just entered the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel rose and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been in the store?&rdquo; asked the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir, I&rsquo;ve been at school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! to school till now? Why, you must be twenty years old!&rdquo;
      exclaimed Mr. Van Boozenberg, in great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir, in my twentieth year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said Mr. Van B., with the air of a man who is
      in entire perplexity, &ldquo;what on earth has your boy been doing at
      school until now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was his grandfather&rsquo;s will, Sir,&rdquo; replied Boniface
      Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, a great pity! a werry great pity! Ma wanted one of our
      boys to go to college. Ma, sez I, what on earth should Corlaer go to
      college for? To get learnin&rsquo;, pa, sez ma. To get learnin&rsquo;! sez
      I. I&rsquo;ll get him learnin&rsquo;, sez I, down to the store, Werry
      well, sez ma. Werry well, sez I, and so &lsquo;twas; and I think I done a
      good thing by him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Van Boozenberg talked at much greater length of his general
      intercourse with ma. Mr. Boniface Newt regarded him more and more
      contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the familiar style of the old gentleman&rsquo;s conversation begot a
      corresponding familiarity upon the part of Mr. Newt. Mr. Van Boozenberg
      learned incidentally that Abel had never been in business before. He
      observed the fresh odor of cigars in the counting-room&mdash;he remarked
      the extreme elegance of Abel&rsquo;s attire, and the inferential tailor&rsquo;s
      bills. He learned that Mrs. Newt and the family were enjoying themselves
      at Saratoga. He derived from the conversation and his observation that
      there were very large family expenses to be met by Boniface Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile that gentleman had continually no other idea of his visitor than
      that he was insufferable. He had confessed to Abel that the old man was
      shrewd. His shrewdness was a proverb. But he is a dull, ignorant,
      ungrammatical, and ridiculous old ass for all that, thought Boniface Newt;
      and the said ass sitting in Boniface Newt&rsquo;s counting-room, and
      amusing and fatiguing Messrs. Newt &amp; Son with his sez I&rsquo;s, and
      sez shes, and his mas, and his done its, was quietly making up his mind
      that the house of Newt &amp; Son had received no accession of capital or
      strength by the entrance of the elegant Abel into a share of its active
      management, and that some slight whispers which he had heard remotely
      affecting the standing of the house must be remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A werry pretty store you have here, Mr. Newt. Find Pearl Street as
      good as Beaver?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, Sir,&rdquo; replied Boniface Newt, bowing and rubbing his
      hands. &ldquo;Call again, Sir; it&rsquo;s a rare pleasure to see you here,
      Mr. Van Boozenberg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, ma, sez she, now pa you mustn&rsquo;t sit in
      draughts. It&rsquo;s so sort of draughty down town in your horrid offices,
      pa, sez she&mdash;sez ma, you know&mdash;that I&rsquo;m awful &lsquo;fraid
      you&rsquo;ll catch your death, sez she, and I must mind ma, you know.
      Good-mornin&rsquo;, Mr. Newt, a werry good-mornin&rsquo;, Sir,&rdquo; said
      the old gentleman, as he stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have much of that sort of thing to undergo in business,
      father?&rdquo; asked Abel, when Jacob Van Boozenberg had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear son,&rdquo; replied the older Mr. Newt, &ldquo;the world is
      made up of fools, bores, and knaves. Some of them speak good grammar and
      use white cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, some do not. It&rsquo;s dreadful,
      I know, and I am rather tired of a world where you are busy driving
      donkeys with a chance of their presently driving you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boniface Newt shook his foot pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is Uncle Lawrence&mdash;a fool, a bore, or a knave?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boniface Newt&rsquo;s foot stopped, and, after looking at his son for
      a few moments, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, your Uncle Lawrence is a singular man. He&rsquo;s a sort of
      exception to general rules. I don&rsquo;t understand him, and he doesn&rsquo;t
      help me to. When he was a boy he went to India and lived there several
      years. He came home once and staid a little while, and then went back
      again, although I believe he was rich. It was mysterious, I never could
      quite understand it&mdash;though, of course, I believe there was some
      woman in it. Neither your mother nor I could ever find out much about it.
      By-and-by he came home again, and has been in business here ever since. He&rsquo;s
      a bachelor, you know, and his business is different from mine, and he has
      queer friends and tastes, so that I don&rsquo;t often see him except when
      he comes to the house, and that isn&rsquo;t very often.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rich, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s very rich, and that&rsquo;s the curious part of it,&rdquo;
      answered his father, &ldquo;and he gives away a great deal of money in
      what seems to me a very foolish way. He&rsquo;s a kind of dreamer&mdash;an
      impracticable man. He pays lots of poor people&rsquo;s rents, and I try to
      show him that he is merely encouraging idleness and crime. But I can&rsquo;t
      make him see it. He declares that, if a sewing-girl makes but two dollars
      a week and has a helpless mother and three small sisters to support
      besides rent and fuel, and so on, it&rsquo;s not encouraging idleness to
      help her with the rent. Well, I suppose it <i>is</i> hard sometimes with
      some of those people. But you&rsquo;ve no right to go by particular cases
      in these matters. You ought to go by the general rule, as I constantly
      tell him. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says he, in that smiling way of his which
      does put me almost beside myself, &lsquo;yes, you shall go by the general
      rule, and let people starve; and I&rsquo;ll go by particular cases, and
      feed &lsquo;em.&rsquo; Then he is just as rich as if he were an old flint
      like Van Boozenberg. Well, it is the funniest, foggiest sort of world. I
      swear I don&rsquo;t see into it at all&mdash;I give it all up. I only know
      one thing; that it&rsquo;s first in first win. And that&rsquo;s extremely
      sad, too, you know. Yes, very sad! Where was I? Ah yes! that we are all
      dirty scoundrels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel had relighted his cigar, after Mr. Van Boozenberg&rsquo;s departure,
      and filled the office with smoke until the atmosphere resembled the fog in
      which his father seemed to be floundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, merchants ought not to smoke cigars in their counting-rooms,&rdquo;
      said his father, in a half-pettish way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; replied Abel, lightly; &ldquo;they ought
      to smoke other people. But tell me, father, do you know nothing about the
      woman that you say was mixed up with Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s affairs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even her name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a syllable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pathetic and mysterious,&rdquo; rejoined Abel; &ldquo;a case of
      unhappy love, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is so,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt, &ldquo;your Uncle Lawrence is
      the happiest miserable man I ever knew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a difference among men, you know, father. Some
      wear their miseries like an order in their button-holes. Some do as the
      Spartan boy did when the wolf bit him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d the Spartan boy do?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He covered it up, laughed, and dropped dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; said Mr. Boniface Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or like Boccaccio&rsquo;s basil-pot,&rdquo; continued Abel, calmly;
      pouring forth smoke, while his befogged papa inquired,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean by Boccaccio&rsquo;s basil-pot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a girl&rsquo;s lover had his head cut off, and she put it in a
      flower-pot, and covered it up that way, and instead of laughing herself,
      set flowers to blooming over it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me, Abel, what are you talking about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Love, the canker-worm, Sir,&rdquo; replied Abel, imperturbable,
      and emitting smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evidently not the busy season in the Dry-goods Commission House of
      Boniface Newt &amp; Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Van Boozenberg went home to dinner, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma, you&rsquo;d better improve this werry pleasant weather and
      start for Saratogy as soon as you can. Mr. Boniface Newt tells me his wife
      and family is there, and you&rsquo;ll find them werry pleasant folks. I
      jes&rsquo; want you to write me all about &lsquo;em. You see, ma, one of
      our directors to-day sez to me, after board, sez he, &lsquo;The Boniface
      Newts is a going it slap-dash up to Saratogy.&rsquo; I laughed, and sez I,
      &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t they? but I don&rsquo;t believe they be,&rsquo;
      sez I. Sez he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you a new shawl for your wife they
      be,&rsquo; sez he. Sez I, &lsquo;Done.&rsquo; So you see ma, if so be they
      be, werry well. A new shawl for some folks, you know; only jes&rsquo;
      write me all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma was not reluctant to depart at the earliest possible moment. Her son
      Corlaer, whose education had been intercepted by his father, was of
      opinion, when he heard that the Newts were at Saratoga, that his health
      imperatively required Congress water. But papa had other views.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corlaer, I wish you would make the acquaintance of young Mr. Newt.
      I done it to-day. He is a well-edicated young man; I shall ask him to
      dinner next Sunday. Don&rsquo;t be out of the way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Van Boozenberg having dined, arose from the table, seated himself in
      a spacious easy-chair, and drawing forth the enormous red bandana, spread
      it over his head and face, and after a few muscular twitches, and a
      violent nodding of the head, which caused the drapery to fall off several
      times, finally propped the refractory head against the back of the chair,
      and bobbing and twitching no longer, dropped off into temporary oblivion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; &ldquo;QUEEN AND HUNTRESS.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne leaned out of the window from which she had just scattered the
      fragments of the drawing Arthur Merlin had given her. The night was soft
      and calm, and trees, not far away, entirely veiled her from observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought how different this window was from that other one at home,
      also shaded by the trees; and what a different girl it was who looked from
      it. She recalled that romantic, musing, solitary girl of Pinewood, who
      lived alone with a silent, grave old nurse, and the quiet years that
      passed there like the shadows and sunlight over the lawn. She remembered
      the dark, handsome face that seemed to belong to the passionate poems that
      girl had read, and the wild dreams she had dreamed in the still, old
      garden. In the hush of the summer twilight she heard again the rich voice
      that seemed to that other girl of Pinewood sweeter than the music of the
      verses, and felt the penetrating glance, that had thrilled the heart of
      that girl until her red cheek was pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      How well for that girl that the lips which made the music had never
      whispered love! Because&mdash;because&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope raised herself from lightly leaning on the window-sill as the thought
      flashed in her mind, and she stood erect, as if straightened by a sudden,
      sharp, almost insupportable pain&mdash;&ldquo;because,&rdquo; she went on
      saying in her mind, &ldquo;had they done so, that other romantic, solitary
      girl at Pinewood&rdquo;&mdash;dear child! Hope&rsquo;s heart trembled for
      her&mdash;&ldquo;might have confessed that she loved!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne clenched her hands, and, all alone in her dim room, flushed,
      and then turned pale, and a kind of cold splendor settled on her face, so
      that if Arthur Merlin could have seen her he would have called her Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the moment in which she thought these things&mdash;for it was
      scarcely more&mdash;the little white bits of paper floated and fell
      beneath her. She watched them as they disappeared, conscious of them, but
      not thinking of them. They looked like rose-leaves, they were so pure; and
      how silently they sank into the darkness below!
    </p>
    <p>
      And if she had confessed she loved, thought Hope, how would it be with
      that girl now? Might she not be standing in the twilight, watching her
      young hopes scattered like rose-leaves and disappearing in the dark?
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands before her, and walked gently up and down the room.
      The full moon was rising, and the tender, tranquil light streamed through
      the trees into her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, she thought, since she did not&mdash;since the young girl dreamed,
      perhaps only for a moment, perhaps so very vaguely, of what might have
      been&mdash;she has given nothing, she has lost nothing. There was a
      pleasant day which she remembers, far back in her childhood&mdash;oh! so
      pleasant! oh! so sunny, and flowery, and serene! A pleasant day, when
      something came that never comes&mdash;that never can come&mdash;but once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped by the window, and looked out to see if she could yet discover
      any signs of the scattered paper. She strained her eyes down toward the
      ground. But it was entirely dark there. All the light was above&mdash;all
      the light was peaceful and melancholy, from the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her face in that moonlight upon the window-sill, and covered it
      with her hands. The low wind shook the leaves, and the trees rustled
      softly as if they whispered to her. She heard them in her heart. She knew
      what they were saying. They sang to her of that other girl and her wishes,
      and struggles and prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the fierce, passionate, profuse weeping&mdash;the spring freshet
      of a woman&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;She heard a low knock at the door. She remained perfectly silent.
      Another knock. Still she did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne raised her head, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a louder knock, and the voice of Fanny Newt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wayne, are you asleep? Please let me in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to resist longer. Hope Wayne opened the door, and Fanny
      Newt entered. Hope sat down with her back to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you come in,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;and I did not hear
      you go out; so I knew you were still here. But I was afraid you would
      oversleep yourself, and miss the ball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope replied that she had not been sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sleeping, but sitting in the moonlight, all alone?&rdquo; said
      Fanny. &ldquo;How romantic!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course it is! Why, Mr. Dinks and I are romantic every
      evening. He <i>will</i> come and sit in the moonlight, and listen to the
      music. What an agreeable fellow he is!&rdquo; And Fanny tried to see Hope&rsquo;s
      face, which was entirely hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my cousin, you know,&rdquo; replied Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, we all know that; and a dangerous relationship it is too,&rdquo;
      said Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dangerous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, cousins are such privileged people. They have all the intimacy
      of brothers, without the brotherly right of abusing us. In fact, a cousin
      is naturally half-way between a brother and a lover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having neither brother nor lover,&rdquo; said Hope, quietly,
      &ldquo;I stop half-way with the cousin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny laughed her cold little laugh. &ldquo;And you mean to go on the
      other half, I suppose?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you suppose so?&rdquo; asked Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is generally understood, I believe,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;that
      Mr. Alfred Dinks will soon lead to the hymeneal altar his beautiful and
      accomplished cousin, Miss Hope Wayne. At least, for further information
      inquire of Mrs. Budlong Dinks.&rdquo; And Fanny laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware of the honor that awaited me,&rdquo; replied Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! of course not. The family reasons, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind is as much in the dark as my body,&rdquo; said Hope.
      &ldquo;I really do not see the point of the joke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still you don&rsquo;t seem very much surprised at it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be? Every girl is at the mercy of tattlers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had me engaged to
      I don&rsquo;t know how many people. I suppose they&rsquo;ll doom Alfred
      Dinks to me next. You won&rsquo;t be jealous, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hope, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll congratulate him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt could not see Hope Wayne&rsquo;s face, and her voice betrayed
      nothing. She, in fact, knew no more than when she came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, dear, <i>à ce soir!</i>&rdquo; said she, as she sailed out
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope lingered for some time at the window. Then she rang for candles, and
      sat down to write a letter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; A STATESMAN&mdash;AND STATESWOMAN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the same twilight Mrs. Dinks and Alfred sat together in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, my dear, I see that Bowdoin Beacon drives out your Cousin
      Hope a good deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks arranged her cap-ribbon as if she were at present mainly
      interested in that portion of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a good deal,&rdquo; replied Mr. Alfred, in an uncertain tone,
      for he always felt uncomfortably at the prospect of a conversation with
      his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised he should do so,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Dinks, with
      extraordinary languor, as if she should undoubtedly fall fast asleep
      before the present interview terminated. And yet she was fully awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he drive her out if he wants to?&rdquo;
      inquired Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Alfred, be careful. Don&rsquo;t expose yourself even to me. It
      is too hot to be so absurd. I suppose there is some sort of honor left
      among young men still, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the languid mamma performed a very well-executed yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor? I suppose there is. What do you mean?&rdquo; replied Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma yawned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How drowsy one does feel here! I am so sleepy! What was I saying?
      Oh I remember. Perhaps, however, Mr. Beacon doesn&rsquo;t know. That is
      probably the reason. He doesn&rsquo;t know. Well, in that case it is not
      so extraordinary. But I should think he must have seen, or inferred, or
      heard. A man may be very stupid; but he has no right to be so stupid as
      that. How many glasses do you drink at the spring in the morning, Alfred?
      Not more than six at the outside, I hope. Well, I believe I&rsquo;ll take
      a little nap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She played with her cap string, somehow as if she were an angler playing a
      fish. There is capital trouting at Saratoga&mdash;or was, thirty years
      ago. You may see to this day a good many fish that were caught there, and
      with every kind of line and bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred bit again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk in such a puzzling kind of way,
      mother. What do you mean about his knowing, and hearing, and inferring?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Alfred, you are getting too cunning. Why, you sly dog,
      do you think you can impose upon me with an air of ignorance because I am
      so sleepy. Heigh-ho.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another successful yawn. Sportsmen are surely the best sport in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Alfred,&rdquo; continued his mother, &ldquo;are you so silly
      as to suppose for one moment that Bowdoin Beacon has not seen the whole
      thing and known it from the beginning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, in alarm, &ldquo;do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. He has eyes and ears, I suppose, and every body
      understood it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they?&rdquo; asked Alfred, bewildered and wretched; &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Every body knew it must be so, and agreed that it was
      highly proper&mdash;in fact the only thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. Clearly the only thing,&rdquo; replied Alfred,
      wondering whether his mother and he meant the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore I say it is not quite honorable in Beacon to drive
      her out in such a marked manner. And I may as well say at once that I
      think you had better settle the thing immediately. The world understands
      it already, so it will be a mere private understanding among ourselves,
      much more agreeable for all parties. Perhaps this evening even&mdash;hey,
      Alfred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks adjusted herself upon the sofa in a sort of final manner, as if
      the affair were now satisfactorily arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talking that way, mother; it&rsquo;s all done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks appeared sleepy no longer. She bounced like an India-rubber
      ball. Even the cap-ribbons were left to shift for themselves. She turned
      and clasped Alfred in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My blessed son!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a moment of silent rapture, during which she moistened his
      shirt-collar with maternal tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; whispered she, &ldquo;are you really engaged?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She squeezed him as if he were a bag of the million dollars of which she
      felt herself to be henceforth mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear, good boy! Then you <i>are</i> sly after all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m afraid I am,&rdquo; rejoined Alfred very
      uncomfortably, and with an extremely ridiculous and nervous impression
      that his mother was congratulating him upon something she knew nothing
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, <i>dear</i>, DEAR boy!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dinks, with a
      crescendo affection and triumph. While she was yet embracing him, his
      father, the unemployed statesman, the Honorable Budlong Dinks, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the infinite surprise of that gentleman, his wife rose, came to him,
      put her arm affectionately in his, and leaning her head upon his shoulder,
      whispered exultingly, and not very softly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done without the wagon. Our dear boy has justified our
      fondest hopes, Budlong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The statesman slipped his shoulder from under her head. If there were one
      thing of which he was profoundly persuaded it was that a really great man&mdash;a
      man to whom important public functions may be properly intrusted&mdash;must,
      under no circumstances, be wheedled by his wife. He must gently, but
      firmly, teach her her proper sphere. She must <i>not</i> attempt to bribe
      that judgment to which the country naturally looks in moments of
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having restored his wife to an upright position, the honorable gentleman
      looked upon her with distinguished consideration; and, playing with the
      seals that hung at the end of his watch-ribbon, asked her, with the most
      protective kindness in the world, what she was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her cap-ribbons properly upon her shoulder, smoothed her dress,
      and began to fan herself in a kind of complacent triumph, as she answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred is engaged as we wished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The honorable gentleman beamed approval with as much cordiality as
      statesmen who are also fathers of private families, as well as of the
      public, ought to indulge toward their children. Shaking the hand of his
      son as if his shoulder wanted oiling, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage is a most important relation. Young men can not be too
      cautious in regard to it. It is not an affair of the feelings merely; but
      common sense dictates that when new relations are likely to arise,
      suitable provision should be made. Hence every well-regulated person
      considers the matter from a pecuniary point of view. The pecuniary point
      of view is indispensable. We can do without sentiment in this world, for
      sentiment is a luxury. We can not dispense with money, because money is a
      necessity. It gives me, therefore, great pleasure to hear that the choice
      of my son has evinced the good sense which, I may say without affectation,
      I hope he has inherited, and has justified the pains and expense which I
      have been at in his education. My son, I congratulate you. Mrs. Dinks, I
      congratulate you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The honorable gentleman thereupon shook hands with his wife and son, as if
      he were congratulating them upon having such an eloquent and dignified
      husband and father, and then blew his nose gravely and loudly. Having
      restored his handkerchief, he smiled in general, as it were&mdash;as if he
      hung out signals of amity with all mankind upon condition of good behavior
      on their part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Alfred was more speechless than ever. He felt very warm and red, and
      began to surmise that to be engaged was not necessarily to be free from
      carking care. He was sorely puzzled to know how to break the real news to
      his parents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear me,&rdquo; thought Alfred; &ldquo;oh! dear me, I wonder if
      Fanny wouldn&rsquo;t do it. I guess I&rsquo;d better ask her. I wonder if
      Hope would have had me! Oh! dear me. I wonder if old Newt is rich. How&rsquo;d
      I happen to do it? Oh! dear me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt very much depressed indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, I&rsquo;m going down,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, dear son! Kiss me, Alfred,&rdquo; replied his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and kissed her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy we shall all be!&rdquo; murmured she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very, very happy!&rdquo; answered Alfred, as he opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he closed it behind him, the best billiard-player at the
      Trimountain billiard-rooms said, ruefully, in his heart, while he went to
      his beloved,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear me! Oh!&mdash;dear&mdash;me! How&rsquo;d I happen to do
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt, of course, had heard from Alfred of the interview with his
      mother on the same evening, as they sat in Mrs. Newt&rsquo;s parlor before
      going into the ball. Fanny was arrayed in a charming evening costume. It
      was low about the neck, which, except that it was very white, descended
      like a hard, round beach from the low shrubbery of her back hair to the
      shore of the dress. It was very low tide; but there was a gentle ripple of
      laces and ribbons that marked the line of division. Mr. Alfred Dinks had
      taken a little refreshment since the conversation with his mother, and
      felt at the moment quite equal to any emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Fanny dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that mother has
      always insisted that I should marry Hope Wayne. Now Hope Wayne is a very
      pretty girl, a deuced pretty girl; but, by George! she&rsquo;s not the
      only girl in the world&mdash;hey, Fanny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Mr. Dinks made free with the lips of Miss Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pah! Alfred, my dear, you have been drinking wine,&rdquo; said she,
      moving gently away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have, darling; haven&rsquo;t I dined?&rdquo; replied
      Alfred, renewing the endearment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Fanny&rsquo;s costume was too careful, her hair too elaborately
      arranged, to withstand successfully these osculatory onsets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, dear, we may as well understand these little matters at
      once,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What little matters, darling?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Dinks, with
      interest. He was unwontedly animated, but, as he explained&mdash;he had
      dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this kissing business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear!&rdquo; cried Alfred, impetuously committing a fresh
      breach of the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Alfred,&rdquo; said Fanny, imperiously. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      have this. I mean,&rdquo; said she, in a mollified tone, remembering that
      she was only engaged, not married&mdash;&ldquo;I mean that you tumble me
      dreadfully. Now, dear, I&rsquo;ll make a little rule. You know you don&rsquo;t
      want your Fanny to look mussed up, do you, dear?&rdquo; and she touched
      his cheek with the tip of one finger. Dinks shook his head negatively.
      &ldquo;Well, then, you shall only kiss me when I am in my morning-dress,
      and one kiss, with hands off, when we say good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a little cold, hard, black smile, smoothing her rumpled
      feathers, and darting glances at herself in the large mirror opposite, as
      if she considered her terms the most reasonable in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me very little,&rdquo; said Alfred Dinks,
      discontentedly; &ldquo;besides, you always look best when you are dressed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, love,&rdquo; returned Fanny; &ldquo;just remember the
      morning-dress, please, for I shall; and now tell me all about your
      conversation with your mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred told the story. Fanny listened with alarm. She had watched Mrs.
      Dinks closely during the whole summer, and she was sure&mdash;for Fanny
      knew herself thoroughly, and reasoned accordingly&mdash;that the lady
      would stop at nothing in the pursuit of her object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a selfish woman it is!&rdquo; thought Fanny. &ldquo;Not
      content with Alfred&rsquo;s share of the inheritance, she wants to bring
      the whole Burt fortune into her family. How insatiable some people are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, has your mother seen Hope since she talked with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you warn her not to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you think of it? If you&rsquo;d only have put
      her off, we could have got time,&rdquo; said Fanny, a little pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got time for what?&rdquo; asked Alfred, blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; said Fanny, coaxing herself to speak gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid you will be trying, dear. I am very much afraid of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover looked doubtful and alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like a fool, Alfred, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
      cried Fanny; but she immediately recovered herself, and said, with a
      smile, &ldquo;You see, dear, how I can scold if I want to. But you&rsquo;ll
      never let me, I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dinks hoped certainly that he never should. &ldquo;But I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      be a very hard husband, Fanny. I shall let you do pretty much as you want
      to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, I know you will,&rdquo; rejoined his charmer. &ldquo;But
      the thing is now to know whether your mother has seen Hope Wayne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and ask her,&rdquo; said Alfred, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; replied Fanny, with her mouth screwed into a
      semblance of smiling, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll drive me distracted. I must
      insist on common sense. It is too delicate a question for you to ask.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dinks grinned and look bewildered. Then he assumed a very serious
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to be hard to ask my mother if she has
      seen my cousin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! you silly&mdash;I mean, my precious darling, your mother&rsquo;s
      too smart for you. She&rsquo;d have every thing out of you in a twinkling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she would,&rdquo; said Alfred, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt wagged her foot very rapidly, and looked fixedly upon the
      floor. Alfred gazed at her admiringly&mdash;thought what a splendid Mrs.
      Alfred Dinks he had secured, and smacked his lips as if he were tasting
      her. He kissed his hand to her as he sat. He kissed the air toward her. He
      might as well have blown kisses to the brown spire of Trinity Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, you must solemnly promise me one thing,&rdquo; she said, at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet,&rdquo; said Alfred, who began to feel that he had dined very
      much, indeed&mdash;&ldquo;sweet, come here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny flushed and wrinkled her brow. Mr. Dinks was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, dear&mdash;no, not at all,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; said she, in a voice as calm but as black as her
      eyes, &ldquo;do you promise or not? That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dinks! He said Yes, in a feeble way, and hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t be
      angry. Indeed&mdash;indeed, he didn&rsquo;t know how much he had been
      drinking. But the fellers kept ordering wine, and he had to drink on; and,
      oh! dear, he wouldn&rsquo;t do so again if Fanny would only forgive him.
      Dear, dear Fanny, please to forgive a miserable feller! And Miss Newt&rsquo;s
      betrothed sobbed, and wept, and half writhed on the sofa in maudlin woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny stood erect, patting the floor with her foot and looking at this
      spectacle. She thought she had counted the cost. But the price seemed at
      this instant a little high. Twenty-two years old now, and if she lived to
      be only seventy, then forty-eight years of Alfred Dinks! It was a very
      large sum, indeed. But Fanny bethought her of the balm in Gilead.
      Forty-eight years of married life was very different from an engagement of
      that period. <i>Courage, ma chère!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; said she, at length, &ldquo;listen to me. Go to your
      mother before she goes to bed to-night, and say to her that there are
      reasons why she must not speak of your engagement to any body, not even to
      Hope Wayne. And if she begins to pump you, tell her that it is the
      especial request of the lady&mdash;whom you may call &lsquo;she,&rsquo;
      you needn&rsquo;t say Hope&mdash;that no question of any kind shall be
      asked, or the engagement may be broken. Do you understand, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny leaned toward him coaxingly as she asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I understand,&rdquo; replied Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll do just as Fanny says, won&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;
      said she, even more caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will, I promise,&rdquo; answered Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may kiss me, dear,&rdquo; said Fanny, leaning toward him, so
      that the operation need not disarrange her toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Dinks kept his word; and his mother was perfectly willing to do as
      she was asked. She smiled with intelligence whenever she saw her son and
      his cousin together, and remarked that Hope Wayne&rsquo;s demeanor did not
      in the least betray the engagement. And she smiled with the same
      intelligence when she remarked how devoted Alfred was to Fanny Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it possibly be that Alfred knows so much?&rdquo; she asked
      herself, wondering at the long time during which her son&rsquo;s cunning
      had lain dormant.

      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; THE PORTRAIT AND THE MINIATURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The golden days of September glimmered through the dark sighing trees, and
      relieved the white brightness that had burned upon the hills during the
      dog-days. Mr. Burt drove into town and drove out. Dr. Peewee called at
      short intervals, played backgammon with his parishioner, listened to his
      stories, told stories of his own, and joined him in his little excursions
      to the West Indies. Mrs. Simcoe was entirely alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Hiram brought her a letter, which she took to her own room and sat
      down by the window to read.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;SARATOGA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR AUNTY,&mdash;We&rsquo;re about going away, and we have been so
      gay that you would suppose I had had &lsquo;society&rsquo; enough. Do you
      remember our talk? There have been a great many people here from every
      part of the country; and it has been nothing but bowling, walking, riding,
      dancing, dining at the lake, and listening to music in the moonlight, all
      the time. Aunt Dinks has been very kind, but although I have met a great
      many people I have not made many friends. I have seen nobody whom I like
      as much as Amy Waring or Mr. Lawrence Newt, of whom I wrote you from New
      York, and they have neither of them been here. I think of Pinewood a great
      deal, but it seems to me long and long ago that I used to live there. It
      is strange how much older and different I feel. But I never forget you,
      dearest Aunty, and I should like this very moment to stand by your side at
      your window as I used to, and look out at the hills, or, better still, to
      lie in your lap or on my bed, and hear you sing one of the dear old hymns.
      I thought I had forgotten them until lately. But I remember them very
      often now. I think of Pinewood a great deal, and I love you dearly; and
      yet somehow I do not feel as if I cared to go back there to live. Isn&rsquo;t
      that strange? Give my love to Grandpa, and tell him I am neither engaged
      to a foreign minister, nor a New York merchant, nor a Southern planter&mdash;nor
      to any body else. But he must keep up heart, for there&rsquo;s plenty of
      time yet. Good-by, dear Aunty. I seem to hear you singing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh that I now the rest might know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how often you used to sing that? Good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate, HOPE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe held the letter in her hand for a long time, looking, as
      usual, out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she rose, and went to a bureau, and unlocked a drawer with a key
      that she carried in her pocket. Taking out an ebony box like a casket, she
      unlocked that in turn, and then lifted from it a morocco case, evidently a
      miniature. She returned to her chair and seated herself again, swaying her
      body gently to and fro as if confirming some difficult resolution, but
      with the same inscrutable expression upon her face. Still holding the case
      in her hands unopened, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a sober mind, A self-renouncing will, That tramples down and
      casts behind The baits of pleasing ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She repeated the whole hymn several times, as if it were a kind of spell
      or incantation, and while she was yet saying it she opened the miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The western light streamed over the likeness of a man of a gallant,
      graceful air, in whom the fires of youth were not yet burned out, and in
      whose presence there might be some peculiar fascination. The hair was
      rather long and fair&mdash;the features were handsomely moulded, but wore
      a slightly jaded expression, which often seems to a woman an air of
      melancholy, but which a man would have recognized at once as the result of
      dissipation. There was a singular cast in the eye, and a kind of lofty,
      irresistible command in the whole aspect, which appeared to be quite as
      much an assumption of manner as a real superiority. In fact it was the
      likeness of what is technically called a man of the world, whose frank
      insolence and symmetry of feature pass for manly beauty and composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miniature was in the face of a gold locket, on the back of which there
      was a curl of the same fair hair. It was so fresh and glossy that it might
      have been cut off the day before. But the quaintness of the setting and
      the costume of the portrait showed that it had been taken many years
      previous, and that in the order of nature the original was probably dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Simcoe held the miniature in both hands and looked at it, her body
      still rocked over it, and her lips still murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then rocking and murmuring stopped together, and she seemed like one
      listening to music or the ringing of distant bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she sat perfectly still in the golden September sunshine, it was as
      if it had shone into her soul; so that a softer light streamed into her
      eyes, and the hard inscrutability of her face melted as by some internal
      warmth, and a tender rejuvenescence somehow blossomed out upon her cheeks
      until all the sweetness became sadness, and heavy tears dropped from her
      eyes upon the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the old harshness stealing into her face again, she rose
      calmly, carrying the miniature in her hand, and went out of the room, and
      down the stairs into the library, which was opposite the parlor in which
      Abel Newt had seen the picture of old Grandpa Burt at the age of ten,
      holding a hoop and book.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were book-shelves upon every side but one&mdash;stately ranges of
      well-ordered books in substantial old calf and gilt English bindings, and
      so carefully placed upon the shelves, in such methodical distribution of
      shapes and sizes, that the whole room had an air of preternatural
      propriety utterly foreign to a library. It seemed the most select and
      aristocratic society of books&mdash;much too fine to permit the excitement
      of interest in any thing they contained&mdash;much too high-bred to be of
      the slightest use in imparting information. Glass doors were carefully
      closed over them and locked, as if the books were beatified and laid away
      in shrines. And the same solemn order extended to the library table, which
      was precisely in the middle of the room, with a large, solemn family Bible
      precisely in the middle of the table, and smaller books, like satellites,
      precisely upon the corners, and precisely on one side an empty glass
      inkstand, innocent of ink spot or stain of any kind, with a pen carefully
      mended and evidently carefully never used, and an exemplary pen-wiper,
      which was as unsullied as might be expected of a wiper which had only
      wiped that pen which was never dipped into that inkstand which had been
      always empty. The inkstand was supported on the other side of the Bible by
      an equally immaculate ivory paper-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large leather library chairs were arranged in precisely the proper
      angle at the corners of the table, and the smaller chairs stood under the
      windows two by two. All was cold and clean, and locked up&mdash;all&mdash;except
      a portrait that hung against the wall, and below which Mrs. Simcoe
      stopped, still holding the miniature in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the likeness of a lovely girl, whose rich, delicate loveliness,
      full of tender but tremulous character, seemed to be a kind of
      foreshadowing of Hope Wayne. The eyes were of a deep, soft darkness, that
      held the spectator with a dreamy fascination. The other features were
      exquisitely moulded, and suffused with an airy, girlish grace, so innocent
      that the look became almost a pathetic appeal against the inevitable
      griefs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Simcoe stood looking at it and at the miniature she held, the
      sadness which had followed the sweetness died away, and her face resumed
      the old rigid inscrutability. She held the miniature straight before her,
      and directly under the portrait; and, as she looked, the apparent pride of
      the one and the tremulous earnestness of the other indescribably blended
      into an expression which had been long familiar to her, for it was the
      look of Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she thus stood, unconscious of the time that passed, the sun had set
      and the room was darkening. Suddenly she heard a sound close at her side,
      and started. Her hand instinctively closed over the miniature and
      concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood a man kindly regarding her. He was not an old man, but there
      was a touch of quaintness in his appearance. He did not speak when she saw
      him, and for several minutes they stood silent together. Then their eyes
      rose simultaneously to the picture, met again, and Mrs. Simcoe, putting
      out her hand, said, in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence Newt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook her hand warmly, and made little remarks, while she seemed to be
      studying into his face, as if she were looking for something she did not
      find there. Every body did it. Every body looked into Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s
      face to discover what he was thinking of, and nobody ever saw. Mrs. Simcoe
      remembered a time when she had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than twenty years since I saw you. Have I grown very
      old?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not old. I see the boy I remember; but your face is not so
      clear as it used to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You compliment me without knowing it. My face is the lid of a chest
      full of the most precious secrets; would you have the lid transparent? I
      am a merchant. Suppose every body could look in through my face and see
      what I really think of the merchandise I am selling! What profit do you
      think I should make? No, no, we want no tell-tale faces in South Street.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this in a tone that corresponded with the expression which baffled
      Mrs. Simcoe, and perplexed her only the more. But it did not repel her nor
      beget distrust. A porcupine hides his flesh in bristling quills; but a
      magnolia, when its time has not yet come, folds its heart in and in with
      over-lacing tissues of creamy richness and fragrance. The flower is not
      sullen, it is only secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are twenty years wiser than you were,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Simcoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is wisdom?&rdquo; asked Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give the heart to God,&rdquo; replied she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I have discovered,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you given it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but haven&rsquo;t you the assurance?&rdquo; asked she,
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; responded Lawrence Newt, in the same kindly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But assurance is a gift,&rdquo; continued she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gift of what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Peace,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Simcoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, I have that,&rdquo; said the other, quietly, as his eyes
      rested upon the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was moisture in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her daughter is very like her,&rdquo; he said, musingly; and the
      two stood together silently for some time looking at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not entirely like her mother,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Simcoe, as if to
      assert some other resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; but I never saw her father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lawrence Newt said this, Mrs. Simcoe raised her hand, opened it, and
      held the miniature before his eyes. He took it and gazed closely at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is Colonel Wayne,&rdquo; said he, slowly. &ldquo;This is
      the man who broke another man&rsquo;s heart and murdered a woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A mingled expression of pain, indignation, passionate regret, and
      resignation suddenly glittered on the face of Mrs. Simcoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt, Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said she, hurriedly, in a thick voice,
      &ldquo;let us at least respect the dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt, still holding the miniature in his hand, looked surprised
      and searchingly at his companion. A lofty pity shot into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I speak of her otherwise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden change in Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s expression conveyed her thought
      to him before her words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! not of <i>her</i>, but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, as if wrestling with a fierce inward agony. The veins on her
      forehead were swollen, and her eyes flashed with singular light. It was
      not clear whether she were trying to say something to conceal something,
      or simply to recover her self-command. It was a terrible spectacle, and
      Lawrence Newt felt as if he must veil his eyes, as if he had no right to
      look upon this great agony of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said he, mechanically, as if by repeating her
      last word to help her in her struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sad, severe woman stood before him in the darkening twilight, erect,
      and more than erect, drawn back from him, and quivering and defiant. She
      was silent for an instant; then, leaning forward and reaching toward him,
      she took the miniature from Lawrence Newt, closed her hand over it
      convulsively, and gasped in a tone that sounded like a low, wailing cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt raised his eyes from the vehement woman to the portrait that
      hung above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the twilight that lost loveliness glimmered down into his very heart
      with appealing pathos. Perhaps those parted lips in their red bloom had
      spoken to him&mdash;lips so long ago dust! Perhaps those eyes, in the days
      forever gone&mdash;gone with hopes and dreams, and the soft lustre of
      youth&mdash;had looked into his own, had answered his fond yearning with
      equal fondness. By all that passionate remembrance, by a lost love, by the
      early dead, he felt himself conjured to speak, nor suffer his silence even
      to seem to shield a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not of him?&rdquo; he began, calmly, and with profound
      melancholy rather than anger. &ldquo;Why not of him, who did not hesitate
      to marry the woman whom he knew loved another, and whom the difference of
      years should rather have made his daughter than his wife? Why not of him,
      who brutally confessed, when she was his wife, an earlier and truer love
      of his own, and so murdered her slowly, slowly&mdash;not with blows of the
      hand, oh no!&mdash;not with poison in her food, oh no!&rdquo; cried
      Lawrence Newt, warming into bitter vehemence, clenching his hand and
      shaking it in the air, &ldquo;but who struck her blows on the heart&mdash;who
      stabbed her with sharp icicles of indifference&mdash;who poisoned her soul
      with the tauntings of his mean suspicions&mdash;mean and false&mdash;and
      the meaner because he knew them to be false? Why not of him, who&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! in the name of God!&rdquo; she cried, fiercely, raising her
      hand as if she appealed to Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell again. The hard voice sank to a tremulous, pitiful tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! stop, if you, are a man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood opposite each other in utter silence. The light had almost
      faded. The face in the picture was no longer visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bewildered and awed by the passionate grief of his companion, Lawrence
      Newt said, gently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I stop?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The form before him had sunk into a chair. Both its hands were clasped
      over the miniature. He heard the same strange voice like the wailing cry
      of a child:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am the woman he loved&mdash;because I loved him.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; GABRIEL AT HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During all this time Gabriel Bennet is becoming a merchant. Every morning
      he arrives at the store with the porter or before him. He helps him sweep
      and dust; and it is Gabriel who puts Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s room in order,
      laying the papers in place, and taking care of the thousand nameless
      details that make up comfort. He reads the newspapers before the other
      clerks arrive, and sits upon chests of tea or bales of matting in the
      loft, that fill the air with strange, spicy, Oriental odors, and talks
      with the porter. In the long, warm afternoons, too, when there is no
      pressure of business, and the heat is overpowering, he sits also alone
      among those odors, and his mind is busy with all kinds of speculations,
      and dreams, and hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walks up Broadway toward evening, his clear, sweet eyes see every
      thing that floats by. He does not know the other side of the fine dresses
      he meets any more than of the fine houses, with the smiling, glittering
      windows. The sun shines bright in his eyes&mdash;the street is gay&mdash;he
      nods to his friends&mdash;he admires the pretty faces&mdash;he wonders at
      the fast men driving fast horses&mdash;he sees the flowers in the windows,
      the smiling faces between the muslin curtains&mdash;he gazes with a kind
      of awe at the funerals going by, and marks the white bands of the
      clergymen and the physicians&mdash;the elm-trees in the hospital yard
      remind him of the woods at Delafield; and here comes Abel Newt, laughing,
      chatting, smoking, with an arm in the arms of two other young men, who are
      also smoking. As Gabriel passes Abel their eyes meet. Abel nods airily,
      and Gabriel quietly; the next moment they are back to back again&mdash;one
      is going up street, the other down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not one of the splendid houses before which Gabriel stops when he
      has reached the upper part of the city. It is not a palace, nor is it near
      Broadway. Nor are there curtains at the window, but a pair of smiling
      faces, of friendly women&rsquo;s faces. One is mild and maternal, with
      that kind of tender anxiety which softens beauty instead of hardening it.
      It has that look which, after she is dead, every affectionate son thinks
      he remembers to have seen in his mother&rsquo;s face; and the other is
      younger, brighter&mdash;a face of rosy cheeks, and clustering hair, and
      blue eyes&mdash;a beaming, loyal, loving, girlish face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both smile welcome to Gabriel, and the younger face, disappearing
      from the window, reappears at the door. Gabriel naturally kisses those
      blooming lips, and then goes into the parlor and kisses his mother. Those
      sympathetic friends ask him what has happened during the day. They see if
      he looks unusually fatigued; and if so, why so? they ask. Gabriel must
      tell the story of the unlading the ship <i>Mary B.</i>, which has just
      come in&mdash;which is Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s favorite ship; but why called
      <i>Mary B.</i> not even Thomas Tray knows, who knows every thing else in
      the business. Then sitting on each side of him on the sofa, those women
      wonder and guess why the ship should be called <i>Mary B.</i> What Mary
      B.? Oh! dear, there might be a thousand women with those initials. And
      what has ever happened to Mr. Newt that he should wish to perpetuate a
      woman&rsquo;s name? Stop! remembers mamma, his mother&rsquo;s name was
      Mary. Mary what? asks the daughter. Mamma, <i>you</i> remember, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma merely replies that his mother&rsquo;s name was Bunley&mdash;Mary
      Bunley&mdash;a famous belle of the close of the last century, when she was
      the most beautiful woman at President Washington&rsquo;s levees&mdash;Mary
      Bunley, to whom Aaron Burr paid his addresses in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mamma; but who was Aaron Burr?&rdquo; ask those blooming lips,
      as the bright young eyes glance from under the clustering curls at her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen, do you remember this spring, as we were coming up Broadway,
      we passed an old man with a keen black eye, who was rather carelessly
      dressed, and who wore a cue, with thick hair of his own, white as snow,
      whom a good many people looked at and pointed out to each other, but
      nobody spoke to?&mdash;who gazed at you as we passed so peculiarly that
      you pressed nearer to me, and asked who it was, and why such an old man
      seemed to be so lonely, and in all that great throng, which evidently knew
      him, was as solitary as if he had been in a desert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly&mdash;I remember it,&rdquo; replies Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That friendless old man, my dear, whom at this moment perhaps
      scarcely a single human being in the world loves, was the most brilliant
      beau and squire of dames that has ever lived in this country; handsome,
      accomplished, and graceful, he has stepped many a stately dance with the
      queenly Mary Bunley, mother of Lawrence Newt. But that was half a century
      ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; asks Ellen, full of interest in her mother&rsquo;s
      words, &ldquo;but why does nobody speak to him? Why is he so alone? Had he
      not better have died half a century ago?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you have seen Mrs. Beriah Dagon, an aunt of Mr. Lawrence
      Newt&rsquo;s? She was Cecilia Bunley, sister of Mary. When she was younger
      she used to go to the theatre with a little green snake coiled around her
      arm like a bracelet. It was the most lovely green&mdash;the softest color
      you ever saw; it had the brightest eyes, the most sinuous grace; it had a
      sort of fascination, but it filled you with fear; fortunately, it was
      harmless. But, Ellen, if it could have stung, how dreadful it would have
      been! Aaron Burr was graceful, and, accomplished, and brilliant; he coiled
      about many a woman, fascinating her with his bright eyes and his sinuous
      manner; but if he had stung, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen shakes her head as her mother speaks, and Gabriel involuntarily
      thinks of Abel Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Bennet goes out of the room to attend to the tea, Gabriel says
      that for his part he doesn&rsquo;t believe in the least that the ship was
      named for old Mrs. Newt; people are not romantic about their mothers; and
      Miss Ellen agrees with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which they sit is small, and very plain. There are only a
      sofa, and table, and some chairs, with shelves of books, and a coarse
      carpet. Upon the wall hangs a portrait representing a young and beautiful
      woman, not unlike Mrs. Bennet; but the beauty of the face is flashing and
      passionate, not thoughtful and mild like that of Gabriel&rsquo;s mother.
      But although every thing is very plain, it is perfectly cheerful. There is
      nothing forlorn in the aspect of the room. Roses in a glass upon the
      table, and the voice and manner of the mother and daughter, tell every
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they go in to tea, and Mr. Bennet joins them. His face is pale,
      and of gentle expression, and he stoops a little in his walk. He wears
      slippers and an old coat, and has the air of a clergyman who has made up
      his mind to be disappointed. But he is not a clergyman, although his white
      cravat, somewhat negligently tied, and his rusty black dress-coat, favor
      that theory. There is a little weariness in his expression, and an
      involuntary, half-deferential smile, as if he fully assented to every
      thing that might be presented&mdash;not because he is especially
      interested in it or believes it, but because it is the shortest way of
      avoiding discussion and getting back to his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel, my son, I am glad to see you!&rdquo; his father says, as
      he seats himself, not opposite his wife, but at one side of the table. He
      inquires if Mr. Newt has returned, and learns that he has been at home for
      several days. He hopes that he has enjoyed his little journey; then sips
      his tea, and looks to see if the windows are closed; shakes himself
      gently, and says he feels chilly; that the September evenings are already
      autumnal, and that the time is coming when we must begin to read aloud
      again after tea. And what book shall we read? Perhaps the best of all we
      can select is Irving&rsquo;s Life of Columbus; Mr. Bennet himself has read
      it in the previous year, but he is sure his children will be interested
      and delighted by it; and, for himself, he likes nothing better than to
      read over and over a book he knows and loves. He puts down his knife as he
      speaks, and plays with his tea-spoon on the edge of the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find myself enchanted with the description of the islands in the
      Gulf, and the life of those soft-souled natives. As I read on, I smell the
      sweet warm odors from the land; I pick up the branches of green trees
      floating far out upon the water; I see the drifting sea-weed, and the
      lights at night upon the shore; then I land, and lie under the palm-trees,
      and hear the mellow tongue of the tropics; I taste the luscious fruits; I
      bask in that rich, eternal sun&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes swim with tropical
      languor as he speaks. He still mechanically balances the spoon upon the
      cup, while his mind is deep sunk in reverie. As his wife glances at him,
      both the look of tenderness and of anxiety in her face deepen. But the
      moment of silence rouses him, and with the nervous smile upon his face, he
      says, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah!&mdash;I&mdash;yes&mdash;let it be Irving&rsquo;s
      Columbus!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward his wife Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s manner is almost painfully thoughtful.
      His eye constantly seeks hers; and when he speaks to her, the mechanical
      smile which greets every body else is replaced by a kind of indescribable,
      touching appeal for forgiveness. It is conveyed in no particular thing
      that he says or does, but it pervades his whole intercourse with her. As
      Gabriel and Ellen grow up toward maturity, Mrs. Bennet observes that the
      same peculiarity is stealing into his manner toward them. It is as if he
      were involuntarily asking pardon for some great wrong that he has
      unconsciously done them. And yet his mildness, and sweetness, and
      simplicity of nature are such, that this singular manner does not disturb
      the universal cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look a little tired to-night, father,&rdquo; says Gabriel, when
      they are all seated in the front room again, by the table, with the lamp
      lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replies the father, who sits upon the sofa, with his
      wife by his side&mdash;&ldquo;yes; Mr. Van Boozenberg was very angry
      to-day about some error he thought he had discovered, and he was quite
      short with us book-keepers, and spoke rather sharply.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight flush passes over Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s face, as if he recalled
      something extremely disagreeable. His eyes become dreamy again; but after
      a moment the old smile returns, and, as if begging pardon, in a half
      bewildered way, he resumes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, his position is trying. Fortunately there wasn&rsquo;t any
      mistake except of his own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He is silent again. After a little while he asks, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we
      have some music? Ellen, can&rsquo;t you sing something?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen thinks she can, if Gabriel will sing second; Gabriel says he will
      try, with pleasure; but really&mdash;he is so overwhelmed&mdash;the state
      of his voice&mdash;he feigns a little cough&mdash;if the crowded and
      fashionable audience will excuse&mdash;he really&mdash;in fact, he will&mdash;but
      he is sure&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this little banter Nellie cries, &ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; mamma
      looks pleased, and papa smiles gently. Then the fresh young voices of the
      brother and sister mingle in &ldquo;Bonnie Doon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The room is not very light, for there is but one lamp upon the table by
      which the singers sit. The parents sit together upon the sofa; and as the
      song proceeds the hand of the mother steals into that of the father, which
      holds it closely, while his arm creeps noiselessly around her waist. Their
      hearts float far away upon that music. His eyes droop as when he was
      speaking of the tropic islands&mdash;as if he were hearing the soft
      language of those shores. As his wife looks at him she sees on his face,
      beneath the weariness of its expression, the light which shone there in
      the days when they sang &ldquo;Bonnie Doon&rdquo; together. He draws her
      closer to him, and his head bows as if by long habit of humility. Her eyes
      gradually fill with tears; and when the song is over her head is lying on
      his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they are still sitting in silence there is a ring at the door, and
      Lawrence Newt and Amy Waring enter the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; BORN TO BE A BACHELOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, Madame,&rdquo; began Lawrence Newt, addressing Mrs.
      Bennet, &ldquo;that I am ashamed of myself&mdash;I ought to have called a
      hundred times. I ask your pardon, Sir,&rdquo; he continued, turning to Mr.
      Bennet, who was standing irresolutely by the sofa, half-leaning upon the
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;ah! I am sure,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bennet, with the
      nervous smile flitting across his face and apparently breaking out all
      over him; and there he remained speechless and bowing, while Mr. Newt
      hastened to seat himself, that every body else might sit down also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet said that she was really, glad to see the face of an old
      friend again whom she had not seen for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I see you every day in Gabriel, my dear Madame,&rdquo; replied
      Lawrence Newt, with quaint dignity. Mother and son both smiled, and the
      father bowed as if the remark had been addressed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy seated herself by Gabriel and Ellen, and talked very animatedly with
      them, while the parents and Mr. Newt sat together. She praised the roses,
      and smelled them very often; and whenever she did so, her eyes, having
      nothing in particular to do at the moment, escaped, as it were, under her
      brows through the petals of the roses as she bent over them, and wandered
      away to Lawrence Newt, whose kind, inscrutable eyes, by the most
      extraordinary chance in the world, seemed to be expecting hers, and were
      ready to receive them with the warmest welcome, and a half-twinkle&mdash;or
      was it no twinkle at all? which seemed to say, &ldquo;Oh! you came&mdash;did
      you?&rdquo; And every time his eyes seemed to say this Amy burst out into
      fresh praises of those beautiful roses to her younger cousins, and pressed
      them close to her cheek, as if she found their moist, creamy coolness
      peculiarly delicious and refreshing&mdash;pressed them so close, indeed,
      that she seemed to squeeze some of their color into her cheeks, which
      Gabriel and Ellen both thought, and afterward declared to their mother, to
      be quite as beautiful as roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy&rsquo;s conversation with her young cousins was very lively indeed,
      but it had not a continuous interest. There were incessant little pauses,
      during which the eyes slipped away again across the room, and fell as
      softly as before, plump into the same welcome and the same little
      interrogation in those other eyes, twinkling with that annoying &ldquo;did
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring was certainly twenty-five, although Gabriel laughed and jeered
      at any such statement. But mamma and the Family Bible were too much for
      him. Lawrence Newt was certainly more than forty. But the Newt Family
      Bible was under a lock of which the key lay in Mrs. Boniface Newt&rsquo;s
      bureau, who, in a question of age, preferred tradition, which she could
      judiciously guide, to Scripture. When Boniface Newt led Nancy Magot to the
      altar, he recorded, in a large business hand, both the date of his
      marriage and his wife&rsquo;s birth. She protested, it was vulgar. And
      when the bridegroom inquired whether the vulgarity were in the fact of
      being born or in recording it, she said: &ldquo;Mr. Newt, I am ashamed of
      you,&rdquo; and locked up the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a vague impression in the Newt family&mdash;Boniface had already
      mentioned it to his son Abel&mdash;that there was something that Uncle
      Lawrence never talked about&mdash;many things indeed, of course, but still
      something in particular. Outside the family nothing was suspected.
      Lawrence Newt was simply one of those incomprehensibly pleasant,
      eccentric, benevolent men, whose mercantile credit was as good as Jacob
      Van Boozenberg&rsquo;s, but who perversely went his own way. One of these
      ways led to all kinds of poor people&rsquo;s houses; and it was upon a
      visit to the widow of the clergyman to whom Boniface Newt had given eight
      dollars for writing a tract entitled &ldquo;Indiscriminate Almsgiving a
      Crime,&rdquo; that Lawrence Newt had first met Amy Waring. As he was
      leaving money with the poor woman to pay her rent, Amy came in with a
      basket of comfortable sugars and teas. She carried the flowers in her
      face. Lawrence Newt was almost blushing at being caught in the act of
      charity; and as he was sliding past her to get out, he happened to look at
      her face, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul! my dear young lady, surely your name is Darro!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dear young lady smiled and colored, and replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mine is not, but my mother&rsquo;s was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was. Those eyes of yours are the Darro eyes. Do you
      think I do not know the Darro eyes when I see them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he took Amy&rsquo;s hand, and said, &ldquo;Whose daughter are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Amy Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then you are Corinna&rsquo;s daughter. Your aunt Lucia married
      Mr. Bennet, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s voice paused
      and hesitated for a moment, &ldquo;and&mdash;there was another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so tenderly respectful in the tone that Amy, with only
      a graver face, replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there was my Aunt Martha.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember all. She is gone; my dear young lady, you will forgive
      me, but your face recalls other years.&rdquo; Then turning to the widow,
      he said, &ldquo;Mrs. Simmer, I am sure that you could have no kinder, no
      better friend than this young lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady looked at him with a gentle inquiry in her eyes as who
      should say, &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s eyes understood in a moment, and he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it as I know that a rose smells sweet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed as he said it, and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you remember to ask your mother if she remembers Lawrence
      Newt, and if he may come and see her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring said Yes, and the gentleman, bending and touching the tips of
      her fingers with his lips, said, &ldquo;Good-by, Mrs. Simmer,&rdquo; and
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called at Mrs. Waring&rsquo;s within a few days afterward. He had known
      her as a child, but his incessant absence from home when he was younger
      had prevented any great intimacy with old acquaintances. But the Darros
      were dancing-school friends and partners. Since those days they had become
      women and mothers. He had parted with Corinna Darro, a black-eyed little
      girl in short white frock and short curling hair and red ribbons. He met
      her as Mrs. Delmer Waring, a large, maternal, good-hearted woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had happened two years before, and during all the time since then
      Lawrence Newt had often called&mdash;had met Amy in the street on many
      errands&mdash;had met her at balls whenever he found she was going. He did
      not ask her to drive with him. He did not send her costly gifts. He did
      nothing that could exclude the attentions of younger men. But sometimes a
      basket of flowers came for Miss Waring&mdash;without a card, without any
      clue. The good-hearted mother thought of various young men, candidates for
      degrees in Amy&rsquo;s favor, who had undoubtedly sent the flowers. The
      good-hearted mother, who knew that Amy was in love with none of them,
      pitied them&mdash;thought it was a great shame they should lose their time
      in such an utterly profitless business as being in love with Amy; and when
      any of them called said, with a good-humored sigh, that she believed her
      daughter would never be any thing but a Sister of Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes also a new book came, and on the fly-leaf was written, &ldquo;To
      Miss Amy Waring, from her friend Lawrence Newt.&rdquo; Then the
      good-hearted mother remarked that some men were delightfully faithful to
      old associations, and that it was really beautiful to see Mr. Newt keeping
      up the acquaintance so cordially, and complimenting his old friend so
      delicately by thinking of pleasing her daughter. What a pity he had never
      married, to have had daughters of his own! &ldquo;But I suppose, Amy, some
      men are born to be bachelors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they are, mother,&rdquo; Amy replied, and found
      immediately after that she had left her scissors, she couldn&rsquo;t
      possibly remember where; perhaps in your room, mamma, perhaps in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must be looked for, however, and, O how curious! there they lay in
      her own room upon the table. In her own room, where she opened the new
      book and read in it for half an hour at a time, but always poring on the
      same page. It was such a profound work. It was so full of weighty matter.
      When would she ever read it through at this rate, for the page over which
      she pored had less on it than any other page in the book. In fact it had
      nothing on it but that very commonplace and familiar form of words,
      &ldquo;To Miss Amy Waring, from her friend Lawrence Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy was entirely of her mother&rsquo;s opinion. Some men are undoubtedly
      born to be bachelors. Some men are born to be as noble as the heroes of
      romances&mdash;simple, steadfast, true; to be gentle, intelligent,
      sagacious, with an experience that has mellowed by constant and various
      intercourse with men, but with a heart that that intercourse has never
      chilled, and a faith which that experience has only confirmed. Some men
      are born to possess every quality of heart, and mind, and person that can
      awaken and satisfy the love of a woman. Yes, unquestionably, said Amy
      Waring in her mind, which was so cool, so impartial, so merely
      contemplating the subject as an abstract question, some men&mdash;let me
      see, shall I say like Lawrence Newt, simply as an illustration?&mdash;well,
      yes&mdash;some men like Lawrence Newt, for instance, are born to be all
      that some women dream of in their souls, and they are the very ones who
      are born to be bachelors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be very sad not to be aware of it, thought Amy. What a profound
      pity it would be if any young woman should not see it, for instance, in
      the case of Lawrence Newt. But when a young woman is in no doubt at all,
      when she knows perfectly well that such a man is not intended by nature to
      be a marrying man, and therefore never thinks of such a thing, but only
      with a grace, and generosity, and delicacy beyond expression offers his
      general homage to the sex by giving little gifts to her, &ldquo;why, then&mdash;then,&rdquo;
      thought Amy, and she was thinking so at the very moment when she sat with
      Gabriel and Ellen, talking in a half wild, lively, incoherent way, &ldquo;why,
      then&mdash;then,&rdquo; and her eyes leaped across the room and fell, as
      it were, into the arms of Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s, which caressed them with
      soft light, and half-laughed &ldquo;You came again, did you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;why,
      then&mdash;then,&rdquo; and Amy buried her face in the cool, damp roses,
      and did not dare to look again, &ldquo;then she had better go and be a
      Sister of Charity.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; MR. ABEL NEWT, GRAND STREET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the world returned to town and the late autumnal festivities began, the
      handsome person and self-possessed style of Mr. Abel Newt became the
      fashion. Invitations showered upon him. Mrs. Dagon proclaimed every where
      that there had been nobody so fascinating since the days of the brilliant
      youth of Aaron Burr, whom she declared that she well remembered, and
      added, that if she could say it without blushing, or if any reputable
      woman ought to admit such things, she should confess that in her younger
      days she had received flowers and even notes from that fascinating man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny, my dears, that he was a naughty man. But I can
      tell you one thing, all the naughty men are not in disgrace yet, though he
      is. And, if you please, Miss Fanny, with all your virtuous sniffs, dear,
      and all your hugging of men in waltzing, darling, Colonel Burr was not
      sent to Coventry because he was naughty. He might have been naughty all
      the days of his life, and Mrs. Jacob Van Boozenberg and the rest of
      &lsquo;em would have been quite as glad to have him at their houses. No,
      no, dears, society doesn&rsquo;t punish men for being naughty&mdash;only
      women. I am older than you, and I have observed that society likes spice
      in character. It doesn&rsquo;t harm a man to have stories told about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No ball was complete without Abel Newt. Ladies, meditating parties,
      engaged him before they issued a single invitation. At dinners he was
      sparkling and agreeable, with tact enough not to extinguish the other men,
      who yet felt his superiority and did not half like it. They imitated his
      manner; but what was ease or gilded assurance in him was open insolence,
      or assurance with the gilt rubbed off, in them. The charm and secret of
      his manner lay in an utter devotion, which said to every woman, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      not a woman in the world who can resist me, except you. Have you the heart
      to do it?&rdquo; Of course this manner was assisted by personal magnetism
      and beauty. Wilkes said he was only half an hour behind the handsomest man
      in the world. But he would never have overtaken him if the handsome man
      had been Wilkes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his dress Abel was costly and elegant. With the other men of his day,
      he read &ldquo;Pelham&rdquo; with an admiration of which his life was the
      witness. Pelham was the Byronic hero made practicable, purged of romance,
      and adapted to society. Mr. Newt, Jun., was one of a small but influential
      set of young men about town who did all they could to repair the
      misfortune of being born Americans, by imitating the habits of foreign
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was presently clear to him that residence under the parental roof was
      incompatible with the habits of a strictly fashionable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are hours, you know, mother, and habits, which make a
      separate lodging much more agreeable to all parties. I have friends to
      smoke, or to drink a glass of punch, or to play a game of whist; and we
      must sing, and laugh, and make a noise, as young men will, which is not
      seemly for the paternal mansion, mother mine.&rdquo; With which he took
      his admiring mother airily under the chin and kissed her&mdash;not having
      mentioned every reason which made a separate residence desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Abel Newt hired a pleasant set of rooms in Grand Street, near Broadway,
      in the neighborhood of other youth of the right set. He furnished them
      sumptuously, with the softest carpets, the most luxurious easy-chairs, the
      most costly curtains, and pretty, bizarre little tables, and bureaus, and
      shelves. Various engravings hung upon the walls; a profile-head of Bulwer,
      with a large Roman nose and bushy whiskers, and one of his Majesty George
      IV., in that famous cloak which Lord Chesterfield bought at the sale of
      his Majesty&rsquo;s wardrobe for eleven hundred dollars, and of which the
      sable lining alone originally cost four thousand dollars. Then there were
      little vases, and boxes, and caskets standing upon all possible places,
      with a rare flower in some one of them often, sent by some kind dowager
      who wished to make sure of Abel at a dinner or a select soiree. Pipes, of
      course, and boxes of choice cigars, were at hand, and in a convenient
      closet such a beautiful set of English cut glass for the use of a
      gentleman!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no wonder that the rooms of Abel Newt became a kind of club-room
      and elegant lounge for the gay gentlemen about town. He even gave little
      dinners there to quiet parties, sometimes including two or three extremely
      vivacious and pretty, as well as fashionably dressed, young women, whom he
      was not in the habit of meeting in society, but who were known quite
      familiarly to Abel and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon other occasions these little dinners took place out of town, whither
      the gentlemen drove alone in their buggies by daylight, and, meeting the
      ladies there, had the pleasure of driving them back to the city in the
      evening. The &ldquo;buggy&rdquo; of Abel&rsquo;s day was an open gig
      without a top, very easy upon its springs, but dangerous with stumbling
      horses. The drive was along the old Boston road, and the rendezvous, Cato&rsquo;s&mdash;Cato
      Alexander&rsquo;s&mdash;near the present shot-tower. If the gentlemen
      returned alone, they finished the evening at Benton&rsquo;s, in Ann
      Street, where they played a game of billiards; or at Thiel&rsquo;s retired
      rooms over the celebrated Stewart&rsquo;s, opposite the Park, where they
      indulged in faro. Abel Newt lost and won his money with careless grace&mdash;always
      a little glad when he won, for somebody had to pay for all this luxurious
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boniface Newt remonstrated. His son was late at the office in the morning.
      He drew large sums to meet his large expenses. Several times, instead of
      instantly filling out the checks as Abel directed, the book-keeper had
      delayed, and said casually to Mr. Newt during Abel&rsquo;s absence at
      lunch, which was usually prolonged, that he supposed it was all right to
      fill up a check of that amount to Mr. Abel&rsquo;s order? Mr. Boniface
      Newt replied, in a dogged way, that he supposed it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day when the sum had been large, and the paternal temper more than
      usually ruffled, he addressed the junior partner upon his return from
      lunch and his noontide glass with his friends at the Washington Hotel, to
      the effect that matters were going on much too rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what matters do you allude, father?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Abel,
      with composure, as he picked his teeth with one hand, and surveyed a cigar
      which he held in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, Sir, that you are spending a great deal too much money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how is that, Sir?&rdquo; asked his son, as he called to the
      boy in the outer office to bring him a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heavens! Abel, you&rsquo;re enough to make a man crazy! Here I
      have put you into my business, over the heads of the clerks who are a
      hundred-fold better fitted for it than you; and you not only come down
      late and go away early, and destroy all kind of discipline by smoking and
      lounging, but you don&rsquo;t manifest the slightest interest in the
      business; and, above all, you are living at a frightfully ruinous rate!
      Yes, Sir, ruinous! How do you suppose I can pay, or that the business can
      pay, for such extravagance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel smoked calmly during this energetic discourse, and blew little rings
      from his mouth, which he watched with interest as they melted in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain things are inevitable, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His parent, frowning and angry, growled at him as he made this remark, and
      muttered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, father,&rdquo; replied his son, with great composure, &ldquo;let
      us proceed calmly. Why should we pretend not to see what is perfectly
      plain? Business nowadays proceeds by credit. Credit is based upon
      something, or the show of something. It is represented by a bank-bill.
      Here now&mdash;&rdquo; And he opened his purse leisurely and drew out a
      five-dollar note of the Bank of New York, &ldquo;here is a promise to pay
      five dollars&mdash;in gold or silver, of course. Do you suppose that the
      Bank of New York has gold and silver enough to pay all those promises it
      has issued? Of course not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel knocked off the ash from his cigar, and took a long contemplative
      whiff, as if he were about making a plunge into views even more profound.
      Mr. Newt, half pleased with the show of philosophy, listened with less
      frowning brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, if by some hocus-pocus the Bank of New York hadn&rsquo;t
      a cent in coin at this moment, it could redeem the few claims that might
      be made upon it by borrowing, could it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt shook his head affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in fine, if it were entirely bankrupt, it could still do a
      tremendous business for a very considerable time, could it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the managers, who knew it to be so, would have plenty of time
      to get off before an explosion, if they wanted to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, what do you mean?&rdquo; inquired his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was still placidly blowing rings of smoke from his mouth,
      and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing terrible. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. It is only an
      illustration of the practical value of credit, showing how it covers a
      retreat, so to speak. Do you see the moral, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; certainly not. I see no moral at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, suppose that nobody wanted to retreat, but that the Bank was
      only to be carried over a dangerous place, then credit is a bridge, isn&rsquo;t
      it? If it were out of money, it could live upon its credit until it got
      the money back again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; answered Mr. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it extended its operations, it would acquire even more
      credit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because people, believing in the solvency of the Bank, would
      suppose that it extended itself because it had more means?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would not feel any dust in their eyes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt, following his son closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then; don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; replied the father; &ldquo;that is, I
      don&rsquo;t see what you mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, father, look here! I come into your business. The fact is
      known. People look. There&rsquo;s no whisper against the house. We extend
      ourselves; we live liberally, but we pay the bills. Every body says,
      &lsquo;Newt &amp; Son are doing a thumping business.&rsquo; Perhaps we are&mdash;perhaps
      we are not. We are crossing the bridge of credit. Before people know that
      we have been living up to our incomes&mdash;quite up, father dear&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
      Newt frowned an entire assent&mdash;&ldquo;we have plenty of money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; cried Boniface Newt, springing
      up, and in so loud a tone that the clerks looked in from the outer office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my marriage,&rdquo; returned Abel, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo; asked Mr. Newt, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an heiress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I am trying to find out,&rdquo; replied Abel, lightly, as
      he threw his cigar away. &ldquo;And now I put it to you, father, as a man
      of the world and a sensible, sagacious, successful merchant, am I not more
      likely to meet and marry such a girl, if I live generously in society,
      than if I shut myself up to be a mere dig?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt was not sure. Perhaps it was so. Upon the whole, it probably was
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abel did not happen to suggest to his father that, for the purpose of
      marrying an heiress, if he should ever chance to be so fortunate as to
      meet one, and, having met her, to become enamored so that he might be
      justified in wooing her for his wife&mdash;that for all these
      contingencies it was a good thing for a young man to have a regular
      business connection and apparent employment&mdash;and very advantageous,
      indeed, that that connection should be with a man so well known in
      commercial and fashionable circles as his father. That of itself was one
      of the great advantages of credit. It was a frequent joke of Abel&rsquo;s
      with his father, after the recent conversation, that credit was the most
      creditable thing going.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; CHECK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During these brilliant days of young bachelorhood Abel, by some curious
      chance, had not met Hope Wayne, who was passing the winter in New York
      with her Aunt Dinks, and who had hitherto declined all society. It was
      well known that she was in town. The beautiful Boston heiress was often
      enough the theme of discourse among the youth at Abel&rsquo;s rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she really going to marry that Dinks? Why, the man&rsquo;s a
      donkey!&rdquo; said Corlaer Van Boozenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are there no donkeys among your married friends?&rdquo;
      inquired Abel, with the air of a naturalist pursuing his researches.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, indeed, as he was passing Stewart&rsquo;s, he saw Hope alighting
      from a carriage. He was not alone; and as he passed their eyes met. He
      bowed profoundly. She bent her head without speaking, as one acknowledges
      a slight acquaintance. It was not a &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; as Abel said to
      himself; &ldquo;not at all. It was simply ranking me with the herd.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that stopping to speak with her?&rdquo; asked Corlaer,
      as he turned back to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Arthur Merlin. Don&rsquo;t you know? He&rsquo;s a
      painter. I wonder how the deuce he came to know her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it was the painter. It was the first time he had met her since
      the summer days of Saratoga; and as he stood talking with her upon the
      sidewalk, and observed that her cheeks had an unusual flush, and her
      manner a slight excitement, he could not help feeling a secret pleasure&mdash;feeling,
      in truth, so deep a delight, as he looked into that lovely face, that he
      found himself reflecting, as he walked away, how very fortunate it was
      that he was so entirely devoted to his art. It is very fortunate indeed,
      thought he. And yet it might be a pity, too, if I should chance to meet
      some beautiful and sympathetic woman; because, being so utterly in love
      with my art, it would be impossible for me to fall in love with her! Quite
      impossible! Quite out of the question!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he thought this he bumped against some one, and looked up
      suddenly. A calm, half-amused face met his glance, as Arthur said,
      hastily, &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pardon is granted,&rdquo; returned the gentleman; &ldquo;but
      still you had better look out for yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall not hit any body else,&rdquo; said Arthur, as he bowed
      and was passing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not speaking of other people,&rdquo; replied the other, with a
      look which was very, friendly, but very puzzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean, then?&rdquo; asked Arthur Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself, of course,&rdquo; said the gentleman with the half-amused
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To guard against Venus rising from the fickle sea, or Hope
      descending from a carriage,&rdquo; rejoined his companion, putting out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked surprised, and, could he have resisted the face of his new
      acquaintance, he would have added indignation to his expression. But it
      was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom do I owe such excellent advice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Lawrence Newt,&rdquo; answered that gentleman, putting out his
      hand. &ldquo;I am glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Arthur Merlin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter shook the merchant&rsquo;s hand cordially. They had some
      further conversation, and finally Mr. Merlin turned, and the two men
      strolled together down town. While they yet talked, Lawrence Newt observed
      that the eyes of his companion studied every carriage that passed. He did
      it in a very natural, artless way; but Lawrence Newt smiled with his eyes,
      and at length said, as if Arthur had asked him the question, &ldquo;There
      she comes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was a little bit annoyed, and said, suddenly, and with a fine air
      of surprise, &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence turned and looked him full in the face; upon which the painter,
      who was so fanatically devoted to his art that it was clearly impossible
      he should fall in love, said, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; as if somebody had
      answered his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment both gentlemen bowed to Hope Wayne, who passed with Mrs.
      Dinks in her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are those gentlemen to whom you are bowing, Hope?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Dinks asked, as she saw her niece lean forward and blush as she bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Merlin and Mr. Lawrence Newt,&rdquo; replied Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I did not observe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while she said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Hope, you could make
      up your mind to go to Mrs. Kingfisher&rsquo;s ball next week? You know you
      haven&rsquo;t been out at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Hope, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please, dear. I think it is quite as well to stay away
      if you want to. Your retirement is very natural, and proper, and
      beautiful, under the circumstances, although it is unusual. Of course I
      don&rsquo;t fully understand. But I have perfect confidence in the justice
      of your reasons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks looked at Hope tenderly and sagaciously as she said this, and
      smiled meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope was entirely bewildered. Then a sudden apprehension shot through her
      mind as she thought of what her aunt had said. She asked suddenly and a
      little proudly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;circumstances,&rsquo; aunt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks was uneasy in her turn. But she pushed bravely on, and said
      kindly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth shouldn&rsquo;t I know why you are unwilling to have
      it known, Hope? You know I am as still as the grave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have what known, aunt?&rdquo; asked Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dinks, confused by Hope&rsquo;s air
      of innocence, &ldquo;your engagement, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My engagement?&rdquo; said Hope, with a look of utter amazement;
      &ldquo;to whom, I should like to know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks looked at her for an instant, and asked, in a clear, dry tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not engaged to Alfred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne&rsquo;s look of anxious surprise melted into an expression of
      intense amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Alfred Dinks!&rdquo; said she, in a slow, incredulous tone, and
      with her eyes sparkling with laughter. &ldquo;Why, my dear aunt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks was overwhelmed by a sudden consciousness of bitter
      disappointment, mingled with an exasperating conviction that she had been
      somehow duped. The tone was thick in which she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Hope, are you deceiving me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew Hope was not deceiving her as well as she knew that they were
      sitting together in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope&rsquo;s reply was a clear, ringing, irresistible laugh. Then she
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time I went to balls, I see. I will go to Mrs.
      Kingfisher&rsquo;s. But, dear aunt, have you seriously believed such a
      story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I think my son is a liar?&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dinks,
      sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laugh faded from Hope&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred Dinks told you I was engaged to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred Dinks told me you were engaged to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove on for some time without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean by using my name in that way?&rdquo; said Hope,
      with the Diana look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that you must settle with him,&rdquo; replied the other.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Field-marshal Mrs. Dinks settled herself back upon the seat and said
      no more. Hope Wayne sat silent and erect by her side.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; AT DELMONICO&rsquo;S.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt had watched with the warmest sympathy the rapid development
      of the friendship between Amy Waring and Hope Wayne. He aided it in every
      way. He called in the assistance of Arthur Merlin, who was in some doubt
      whether his devotion to his art would allow him to desert it for a moment.
      But as the doubt only lasted while Lawrence Newt was unfolding a plan he
      had of reading books aloud with the ladies&mdash;and&mdash;in fact, a
      great many other praiseworthy plans which all implied a constant meeting
      with Miss Waring and Miss Wayne, Mr. Merlin did not delay his co-operation
      in all Mr. Newt&rsquo;s efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they met at Amy Waring&rsquo;s house very often and pretended to
      read, and really did read, several books together aloud. Ostensibly poetry
      was pursued at the meetings of what Lawrence Newt called the Round Table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? We have our King Arthur, and our Merlin the Enchanter,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A speech from Mr. Merlin,&rdquo; cried Amy, gayly, while Hope
      looked up from her work with encouraging, queenly eyes. Arthur looked at
      them eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana! Diana!&rdquo; he thought, but did not say. That was the
      only speech he made, and nobody heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meetings of the Round Table were devoted to poetry, but of a very
      practical kind. It was pure romance, but without any thing technically
      romantic. Mrs. Waring often sat with the little party, and, as she worked,
      talked with Lawrence Newt of earlier days&mdash;&ldquo;days when you were
      not born, dears,&rdquo; she said, cheerfully, as if to appropriate Mr.
      Newt. And whenever she made this kind of allusion Amy&rsquo;s work became
      very intricate indeed, demanding her closest attention. But Hope Wayne,
      remembering her first evening in his society, raised her eyes again with
      curiosity, and as she did so Lawrence smiled kindly and gravely, and his
      eyes hung upon hers as if he saw again what he had thought never to see;
      while Hope resolved that she would ask him under what circumstances he had
      known Pinewood. But the opportunity had not yet arrived. She did not wish
      to ask before the others. There are some secrets that we involuntarily
      respect, while we only know that they are secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Arthur Merlin saw of Hope Wayne the more delighted he was to
      think how impossible it was for him, in view of his profound devotion to
      his art, to think of beautiful women in any other light than that of
      picturesque subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Newt,&rdquo; Arthur said to him one evening as they
      were dining together at Delmonico&rsquo;s&mdash;which was then in William
      Street&mdash;&ldquo;if I were to paint a picture of Diana when she loved
      Endymion&mdash;a picture, by-the-by, which I intend to paint&mdash;I
      should want to ask Miss Wayne to sit to me for the principal figure. It is
      really remarkable what a subdued splendor there is about her&mdash;Diana
      blushing, you know, as it were&mdash;the moon delicately veiled in cloud.
      It would be superb, I assure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt smiled&mdash;he often smiled&mdash;as he wiped his mouth,
      and asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would you ask to sit for Endymion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me see,&rdquo; replied Arthur, cheerfully, and pondering
      as if to determine who was exactly the man. It was really beautiful to see
      his exclusive enthusiasm for his art. &ldquo;Let me see. How would it do
      to paint an ideal figure for Endymion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, laughing; &ldquo;art must get
      its ideal out of the real. I demand a good, solid, flesh-and-blood
      Endymion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just think of any body,&rdquo; replied Arthur Merlin,
      musingly, looking upon the floor, and thinking so intently of Hope, in
      order to image to himself a proper Endymion, that he quite forgot to think
      of the candidates for that figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would my young friend Hal Battlebury answer?&rdquo; asked
      Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo; replied Arthur, promptly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      too light, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me see,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;what do you
      think of that young Southerner, Sligo Moultrie, who was at Saratoga? I
      used to think he had some of the feeling for Hope Wayne that Diana wanted
      in Endymion, and he has the face for a picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s not at all the person. He&rsquo;s much too dark, you
      see,&rdquo; answered Arthur, at once, with remarkable readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Alfred Dinks,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; said Arthur, conclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I can not think of any body,&rdquo; returned his companion,
      with a mock gravity that Arthur probably did not perceive. The young
      artist was evidently very closely occupied with the composition of his
      picture. He half-closed his eyes, as if he saw the canvas distinctly, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should represent her just lighting upon the hill, you see, with a
      rich, moist flush upon her face, a cold splendor just melting into
      passion, half floating, as she comes, so softly superior, so queenly
      scornful of all the world but him. Jove! it would make a splendid picture!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt looked at his friend as he imagined the condescending Diana.
      The artist&rsquo;s face was a little raised as he spoke, as if he saw a
      stately vision. It was rapt in the intensity of fancy, and Lawrence knew
      perfectly well that he saw Hope Wayne&rsquo;s Endymion before him. But at
      the same moment his eye fell upon his nephew Abel sitting with a choice
      company of gay youths at another table. There was instantly a mischievous
      twinkle in Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eureka! I have Endymion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur started and felt a half pang, as if Lawrence Newt had suddenly told
      him of Miss Wayne&rsquo;s engagement. He came instantly out of the clouds
      on Latinos, where he was dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, how dull I am! Abel will be your Endymion, if you
      can get him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Abel?&rdquo; inquired Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my nephew, Abel Don Juan Pelham Newt, of Grand Street, and
      Boniface Newt, Son, &amp; Company, Dry Goods on Commission, Esquire,&rdquo;
      replied Lawrence Newt, with perfect gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked at him bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know my nephew, Abel Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not personally. I&rsquo;ve heard of him, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a very handsome young man; and though he be dark,
      he may also be Endymion. Why not? Look at him; there he sits. &lsquo;Tis
      the one just raising the glass to his lips.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt bent his head as he spoke toward the gay revelers, who sat,
      half a dozen in number, and the oldest not more than twenty-five, all
      dandies, all men of pleasure, at a neighboring table spread with a profuse
      and costly feast. Abel was the leader, and at the moment Arthur Merlin and
      Lawrence Newt turned to look he was telling some anecdote to which they
      all listened eagerly, while they sipped the red wine of France, poured
      carefully from a bottle reclining in a basket, and delicately coated with
      dust. Abel, with his glass in his hand and the glittering smile in his
      eye, told the story with careless grace, as if he were more amused with
      the listeners&rsquo; eagerness than with the anecdote itself. The extreme
      gayety of his life was already rubbing the boyish bloom from his face, but
      it developed his peculiar beauty more strikingly by removing that
      incongruous innocence which belongs to every boyish countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked at him, Arthur Merlin was exceedingly impressed by the air of
      reckless grace in his whole appearance, which harmonized so entirely with
      his face. Lawrence Newt watched his friend as the latter gazed at Abel.
      Lawrence always saw a great deal whenever he looked any where. Perhaps he
      perceived the secret dissatisfaction and feeling of sudden alarm which,
      without any apparent reason, Arthur felt as he looked at Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the longer Arthur Merlin looked at Abel the more curiously perplexed
      he was. The feeling which, if he had not been a painter so utterly devoted
      to his profession that all distractions were impossible, might have been
      called a nascent jealousy, was gradually merged in a half-consciousness
      that he had somewhere seen Abel Newt before, but where, and under what
      circumstances, he could not possibly remember. He watched him steadily,
      puzzling himself to recall that face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he clapped his hand upon the table. Lawrence Newt, who was
      looking at him, saw the perplexity of his expression smooth itself away;
      while Arthur Merlin, with an &ldquo;oh!&rdquo; of surprise, satisfaction,
      and alarm, exclaimed&mdash;and his color changed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Manfred in the Coliseum!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was confounded. Was Arthur, then, not deceiving himself,
      after all? Did he really take an interest in all these people only as a
      painter, and think of them merely as subjects for pictures?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was troubled. He had seen in Arthur with delight what he
      supposed the unconscious beginnings of affection for Hope Wayne. He had
      pleased himself in bringing them together&mdash;of course Amy Waring must
      be present too when he himself was, that any <i>tête-à-tête</i> which
      arose might not be interrupted&mdash;and he had dreamed the most agreeable
      dreams. He knew Hope&mdash;he knew Arthur&mdash;it was evidently the hand
      of Heaven. He had even mentioned it confidentially to Amy Waring, who was
      profoundly interested, and who charitably did the same offices for Arthur
      with Hope Wayne that Lawrence Newt did for the young candidates with her.
      The conversation about the picture of Diana had only confirmed Lawrence
      Newt in his conviction that Arthur Merlin really loved Hope Wayne, whether
      he himself knew it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now was he all wrong, after all? Ridiculous! How could he be?
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to persuade himself that he was not. But he could not forget how
      persistently Arthur had spoken of Hope only as a fine Diana; and how,
      after evidently being struck with Abel Newt, he had merely exclaimed, with
      a kind of suppressed excitement, as if he saw what a striking picture he
      would make, &ldquo;Manfred in the Coliseum!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt drank a glass of wine, thoughtfully. Then he smiled
      inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the first time I have been mistaken,&rdquo; thought he.
      &ldquo;I shall have to take Amy Waring&rsquo;s advice about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he and his friend passed the other table, on their way out, Abel nodded
      to his uncle; and as Arthur Merlin looked at him carefully, he was very
      sure that he saw the person whose face so singularly resembled that of
      Manfred&rsquo;s in the picture he had given Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all wrong,&rdquo; thought Lawrence Newt, ruefully, as they
      passed out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel Newt, then, is Hope Wayne&rsquo;s somebody,&rdquo; thought
      Arthur Merlin, as he took his friend&rsquo;s arm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; MRS. THEODORE KINGFISHER AT HOME. <i>On dansera.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Society stared when it beheld Miss Hope Wayne entering the drawing-room of
      Mrs. Theodore Kingfisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Miss Wayne, I am delighted,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kingfisher,
      with a smile that might have been made at the same shop with the flowers
      that nodded over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kingfisher&rsquo;s friendship for Miss Wayne and her charming aunt
      consisted in two pieces of pasteboard, on which was printed, in German
      text, &ldquo;Mrs. Theodore Kingfisher, St. John&rsquo;s Square,&rdquo;
      which she had left during the winter; and her pleasure at seeing her was
      genuine&mdash;not that she expected they would solace each other&rsquo;s
      souls with friendly intercourse, but that she knew Hope to be a famous
      beauty who had held herself retired until now at the very end of the
      season, when she appeared for the first time at her ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection secured an unusually ardent reception for Mrs. Dagon, who
      followed Mrs. Dinks&rsquo;s party, and who, having made her salutation to
      the hostess, said to Mr. Boniface Newt, her nephew, who accompanied her,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go and stand by the pier-glass, so that I can rake
      the rooms. And, Boniface, mind, I depend upon your getting me some lobster
      salad at supper, with plenty of dressing&mdash;mind, now, plenty of
      dressing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perched like a contemplative vulture by the pier, Mrs. Dagon declined
      chairs and sofas, but put her eye-glass to her eyes to spy out the land.
      She had arrived upon the scene of action early. She always did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see every body come in. There&rsquo;s a great deal in
      watching how people speak to each other. I&rsquo;ve found out a great many
      things in that way, my dear, which were not suspected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a glass at the other end of the room that was bobbing up and
      down and about at everybody and thing&mdash;at the ceiling, and the wall,
      and the carpet&mdash;discovering the rouge upon cheeks whose ruddy
      freshness charmed less perceptive eyes&mdash;reducing the prettiest lace
      to the smallest terms in substance and price&mdash;detecting base cotton
      with one fell glance, and the part of the old dress ingeniously furbished
      to do duty as new&mdash;this philosophic and critical glass presently
      encountered Mrs. Dagon&rsquo;s in mid-career. The two ladies behind the
      glasses glared at each other for a moment, then bowed and nodded, like two
      Chinese idols set up on end at each extremity of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, dear, good Mrs. Winslow Orry,&rdquo; said the smiling
      eyes of Mrs. Dagon to that lady. &ldquo;How doubly scraggy you look in
      that worn-out old sea-green satin!&rdquo; said the smiling old lady to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do, darling Mrs. Dagon?&rdquo; said the responsive glance of
      Mrs. Orry, with the most gracious effulgence of aspect, as she glared
      across the room&mdash;inwardly thinking, &ldquo;What a silly old hag to
      lug that cotton lace cape all over town!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      People poured in. The rooms began to swarm. There was a warm odor of kid
      gloves, scent-bags, and heliotrope. There was an incessant fluttering of
      fans and bobbing of heads. One hundred gentlemen said, &ldquo;How warm it
      is!&rdquo; One hundred ladies of the highest fashion answered, &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
      Fifty young men, who all wore coats, collars, and waistcoats that seemed
      to have been made in the lump, and all after the same pattern, stood
      speechless about the rooms, wondering what under heaven to do with their
      hands. Fifty older married men, who had solved that problem, folded their
      hands behind their backs, and beamed vaguely about, nodding their heads
      whenever they recognized any other head, and saying, &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo;
      and then, after a little more beaming, &ldquo;How are yer?&rdquo; Waiters
      pushed about with trays covered with little glasses of lemonade and
      port-sangaree, which offered favorable openings to the unemployed young
      men and the married gentlemen, who crowded along with a glass in each
      hand, frightening all the ladies and begging every body&rsquo;s pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Knickerbocker jewels glittered about the rooms. Mrs. Bleecker Van
      Kraut carried not less than thirty thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of
      diamonds upon her person&mdash;at least that was Mrs. Orry&rsquo;s
      deliberate conclusion after a careful estimate. Mrs. Dagon, when she heard
      what Mrs. Orry said, merely exclaimed, &ldquo;Fiddle! Anastatia Orry can
      tell the price of lutestring a yard because Winslow Orry failed in that
      business, but she knows as much of diamonds as an elephant of good
      manners.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Van Kraut property had been bowing about the drawing-rooms of New York
      for a year or two, watched with palpitating hearts and longing eyes. Until
      that was disposed of, nothing else could win a glance. There were several
      single hundreds of thousands openly walking about the same rooms, but
      while they were received very politely, they were made to feel that two
      millions were in presence and unappropriated, and they fell humbly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt, upon her debut in society, had contemplated the capture of the
      Van Kraut property; but the very vigor with which she conducted the
      campaign had frightened the poor gentleman who was the present member for
      that property, in society, so that he shivered and withdrew on the dizzy
      verge of a declaration; and when he subsequently encountered Lucy Slumb,
      she was immediately invested with the family jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven save me from a smart woman!&rdquo; prayed Bleecker Van
      Kraut; and Heaven heard and kindly granted his prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, while the hot hum went on, and laces, silks, satins, brocades,
      muslins, and broadcloth intermingled and changed places, so that Arthur
      Merlin, whom Lawrence Newt had brought, declared the ball looked like a
      shot silk or a salmon&rsquo;s belly&mdash;upon overhearing which, Mrs.
      Bleecker Van Kraut, who was passing with Mr. Moultrie, looked unspeakable
      things&mdash;the quick eyes of Fanny Newt encountered the restless orbs of
      Mrs. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred had left town for Boston on the very day on which Hope Wayne had
      learned the story of her engagement. Neither his mother nor Hope,
      therefore, had had an opportunity of asking an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see Miss Wayne with you to-night,&rdquo; said Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece is her own mistress,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dinks, in a
      sub-acid tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s eyes grew blacker and sharper in a moment. An Indian whose
      life depends upon concealment from his pursuer is not more sensitive to
      the softest dropping of the lightest leaf than was Fanny Newt&rsquo;s
      sagacity to the slightest indication of discovery of her secret. There is
      trouble, she said to herself, as she heard Mrs. Dinks&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wayne has been a recluse this winter,&rdquo; remarked Fanny,
      with infinite blandness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has had some kind of whim,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dinks,
      shaking her shoulders as if to settle her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We girls have all suspected, you know, of course, Mrs. Dinks,&rdquo;
      said Miss Newt, with a very successful imitation of archness and a little
      bend of the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, indeed!&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Dinks, in almost a bellicose
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, dear Mrs. Dinks; don&rsquo;t you remember at Saratoga&mdash;you
      know?&rdquo; continued Fanny, with imperturbable composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened at Saratoga?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dinks, with smooth
      defiance on her face, and conscious that she had never actually mentioned
      any engagement between Alfred and Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! So many things happen at Saratoga,&rdquo; answered Fanny,
      bridling like a pert miss of seventeen. &ldquo;And when a girl has a
      handsome cousin, it&rsquo;s very dangerous.&rdquo; Fanny Newt was
      determined to know where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some girls are very silly and willful,&rdquo; tartly remarked Mrs.
      Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Fanny, with extraordinary coolness,
      continuing the <i>rôle</i> of the arch maid of seventeen&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suppose, if every thing one hears is true, we may congratulate you, dear
      Mrs. Dinks, upon an interesting event?&rdquo; And Fanny raised her bouquet
      and smelled at it vigorously&mdash;at least, she seemed to be doing so,
      because the flowers almost covered her face, but really they made an
      ambush from which she spied the enemy, unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark she had made had been made a hundred times before to Mrs.
      Dinks. In fact, Fanny herself had used it, under various forms, to assure
      herself, by the pleased reserve of the reply which Mrs. Dinks always
      returned, that the lady had no suspicion that she was mistaken. But this
      time Mrs. Dinks, whose equanimity had been entirely disturbed by her
      discovery that Hope was not engaged to Alfred, asked formally, and not
      without a slight sneer which arose from an impatient suspicion that Fanny
      knew more than she chose to disclose&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Miss Newt, what do people hear? Really, if other people
      are as unfortunate as I am, they hear a great deal of nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Mrs. Budlong Dinks sniffed the air like a charger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&mdash;it is really dreadful,&rdquo; returned Fanny Newt.
      &ldquo;People do say the most annoying and horrid things. But this time, I
      am sure, there can be nothing very vexatious.&rdquo; And Miss Newt fanned
      herself with persistent complacency, as if she were resolved to prolong
      the pleasure which Mrs. Dinks must undoubtedly have in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto it had been the policy of that lady to demur and insinuate, and
      declare how strange it was, and how gossipy people were, and finally to
      retreat from a direct reply under cover of a pretty shower of ohs! and
      ahs! and indeeds! and that policy had been uniformly successful. Everybody
      said, &ldquo;Of course Alfred Dinks and his cousin are engaged, and Mrs.
      Dinks likes to have it alluded to&mdash;although there are reasons why it
      must be not openly acknowledged.&rdquo; So Field-marshal Mrs. Dinks
      outgeneraled Everybody. But the gallant young private, Miss Fanny Newt,
      was resolved to win her epaulets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Dinks made no reply, and assumed the appearance of a lady who, for
      her own private and inscrutable reasons, had concluded to forego the
      prerogative of speech for evermore, while she fanned herself calmly, and
      regarded Fanny with a kind of truculent calmness that seemed to say,
      &ldquo;What are you going to do about that last triumphant move of mine?&rdquo;
      Fanny proceeded in a strain of continuous sweetness that fairly rivaled
      the smoothness of the neck, and the eyes, and the arms of Mrs. Bleecker
      Van Kraut:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there can be nothing very disagreeable to Miss Wayne&rsquo;s
      friends in knowing that she is engaged to Mr. Alfred Dinks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! Mrs. Dinks, who knew Hope, knew that the time for dexterous
      subterfuges and misleadings had passed. She resolved that people, when
      they discovered what they inevitably soon must discover, should not
      suppose that she had been deceived. So, looking straight into Fanny Newt&rsquo;s
      eyes without flinching&mdash;and somehow it was not a look of profound
      affection&mdash;she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware of any such engagement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied the undaunted Fanny, &ldquo;I have heard
      that love is blind, but I did not know that it was true of maternal love.
      Mr. Dinks&rsquo;s mother is not his confidante, then, I presume?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bad passions of Mr. Dinks&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s heart were like the
      heathen, and furiously raged together at this remark. She continued the
      fanning, and said, with a sickly smile,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Newt, you can contradict from me the report of any such
      engagement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough. Fanny was mistress of the position. If Mrs. Dinks were
      willing to say that, it was because she was persuaded that it never would
      be true. She had evidently discovered something. How much had she
      discovered? That was the next step.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these reflections flashed through the mind of Miss Fanny Newt, and her
      cold black eye shone with a stony glitter, she was conscious that the time
      for some decisive action upon her part had arrived. To be or not to be
      Mrs. Alfred Dinks was now the question; and even as she thought of it she
      felt what must be done. She did not depreciate the ability of Mrs. Dinks,
      and she feared her influence upon Alfred. Poor Mr. Dinks! he was at that
      moment smoking a cigar upon the forward deck of the <i>Chancellor
      Livingston</i> steamer, that plied between New York and Providence. Mr.
      Bowdoin Beacon sat by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real good girl, and pretty, and rich, though she is
      my cousin, Bowdoin. So why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beacon, a member of the upper sex, replied, gravely, &ldquo;Well,
      perhaps!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were speaking of Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant also, in Mrs. Kingfisher&rsquo;s swarming
      drawing-rooms, looking on at the dancers and listening to the music, stood
      Hope Wayne, Lawrence Newt, Amy Waring, and Arthur Merlin. They were
      chatting together pleasantly, Lawrence Newt usually leading, and Hope
      Wayne bending her beautiful head, and listening and looking at him in a
      way to make any man eloquent. The painter had been watching for Mr. Abel
      Newt&rsquo;s entrance, and, after he saw him, turned to study the effect
      produced upon Miss Wayne by seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abel, who saw as much in his way as Mrs. Dagon in hers, although
      without the glasses, had carefully kept in the other part of the rooms. He
      had planted his batteries before Mrs. Bleecker Van Kraut, having resolved
      to taste her, as Herbert Octoyne had advised, notwithstanding that she had
      no flavor, as Abel himself had averred.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who eats merely for the flavor of the food?
    </p>
    <p>
      That lady clicked smoothly as Abel, metaphorically speaking, touched her.
      Louis Wilkottle, her cavalier, slipped away from her he could not tell
      how: he merely knew that Abel Newt was in attendance, vice Wilkottle,
      disappeared. So Wilkottle floated about the rooms upon limp pinions for
      sometime, wondering where to settle, and brushed Fanny Newt in flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Wilkottle, you are just the man. Mr. Whitloe, Laura Magot,
      and I were just talking about Batrachian reptiles. Which are the best
      toads, the fattest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or does it depend upon the dressing?&rdquo; asked Mr. Whitloe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the quantity of jewelry in the head?&rdquo; said Laura Magot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilkottle smiled, bowed, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had called him an ass&mdash;as they were ladies of the best
      position&mdash;he would have bowed, smiled, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An amiable fellow,&rdquo; said Fanny, as he disappeared; &ldquo;but
      quite a remarkable fool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Zephyr Wetherley, still struggling with the hand problem, approached
      Miss Fanny, and remarked that it was very warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re cool enough in all conscience, Mr. Wetherley,&rdquo;
      said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Newt, &lsquo;pon honor,&rdquo; replied Zephyr,
      beginning to be very red, and wiping his moist brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call any man cool who would have told St. Lawrence upon the
      gridiron that he was frying,&rdquo; interrupted Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;ah!&mdash;yes!&mdash;on the gridiron! Yes, very good! Ha!
      ha! Quite on the gridiron&mdash;very much so! &lsquo;Tis very hot here.
      Don&rsquo;t you think so? It&rsquo;s quite confusing, like&mdash;sort of
      bewildering. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Miss Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was leveling her black eyes at him for a reply, but Mr. Wetherley,
      trying to regulate his hands, said, hastily,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite on the gridiron&mdash;very!&rdquo; and rapidly moved off
      it by moving on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, Mrs. Newt,&rdquo; said a voice in another part
      of the room. &ldquo;Good-evenin&rsquo;, marm. I sez to ma, Now ma, sez I,
      you&rsquo;d better go to Mrs. Kingfisher&rsquo;s ball. Law, pa, sez she, I
      reckon &lsquo;twill be so werry hot to Mrs. Kingfisher&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;d
      better stay to home, sez she. So she staid. Well, &lsquo;tis dreadful hot,
      Mrs. Newt. I&rsquo;m all in a muck. As I was a-puttin&rsquo; on my coat, I
      sez, Now, ma, sez I, I hate to wear that coat, sez I. A man does git so
      nasty sweaty in a great, thick coat, sez I. Whew! I&rsquo;m all sticky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Van Boozenberg worked himself in his garments and stretched his
      arms to refresh himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boniface Newt, to whom he made this oration, had been taught by her
      husband that Mr. Van Boozenberg was an oaf, but an oaf whose noise was to
      be listened to with the utmost patience and respect. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
      brute, my dear; but what can we do? When I am rich we can get rid of such
      people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Jacob Van Boozenberg had his little theory of Boniface
      Newt, which, unlike that worthy commission merchant, he did not impart to
      his ma and the partner of his bosom, but locked up in the vault of his own
      breast. Mr. Van B. gloried in being what he called a self-made man. He was
      proud of his nasal twang and his want of grammar, and all amenities and
      decencies of speech. He regarded them as inseparable from his success. He
      even affected them in the company of those who were peculiarly elegant,
      and was secretly suspicious of the mercantile paper of all men who were
      unusually neat in their appearance, and who spoke their native language
      correctly. The partner of his bosom was the constant audience of his
      self-glorification.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while before, her lord had returned one day to dinner, and said,
      with a tone of triumph,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma, Gerald Bennet &amp; Co. have busted up&mdash;smashed all
      to pieces. Always knew they would. I sez to you, ma, a hundred times&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you remember?&mdash;Now, ma, sez I, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t no use. He&rsquo;s
      been to college, and he talks grammar, and all that; but what&rsquo;s the
      use? What&rsquo;s the use of talkin&rsquo; grammar? Don&rsquo;t help
      nothin&rsquo;. A man feels kind o&rsquo; stuck up when he&rsquo;s been to
      college. But, ma, sez I, gi&rsquo; me a self-made man&mdash;a man what
      knows werry well that twice two&rsquo;s four. A self-made man ain&rsquo;t
      no time for grammar, sez I. If a man expects to get on in this world he
      mustn&rsquo;t be too fine. This is the second time Bennet&rsquo;s busted.
      Better have no grammar and more goods, sez I. You remember&mdash;hey, ma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When, a little while afterward, Mr. Bennet applied for a situation as
      book-keeper in the bank of which Mr. Van Boozenberg was president, that
      officer hung, drew, and quartered the English language, before the very
      eyes of Mr. Bennet, to show him how he despised it, and to impress him
      with the great truth that he, Jacob Van Boozenberg, a self-made man, who
      had no time to speak correctly, nor to be comely or clean, was yet a
      millionaire before whom Wall Street trembled&mdash;while he, Gerald
      Bennet, with all his education, and polish, and care, and scrupulous
      neatness and politeness, was a poverty-stricken, shiftless vagabond; and
      what good had grammar done him? The ruined gentleman stood before the
      president&mdash;who was seated in his large armchair at the bank&mdash;holding
      his hat uncertainly, the nervous smile glimmering like heat lightning upon
      his pale, anxious face, in which his eyes shone with that singular, soft
      light of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Bennet, I sez to ma this very mornin&rsquo;&mdash;sez I,
      &lsquo;Ma, I s&rsquo;pose Mr. Bennet &lsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; a place in
      our bank. If he hadn&rsquo;t been so wery fine,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;he
      might have got on. He talks be-youtiful grammar, ma,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
      the worthy President, screwing in the taunt, as it were; &ldquo;&lsquo;but
      grammar ain&rsquo;t good to eat,&rsquo; sez I. &lsquo;He ain&rsquo;t a
      self-made man, as some folks is,&rsquo; sez I; &lsquo;but I suppose I&rsquo;ll
      have to stick him in somewheres,&rsquo; sez I&mdash;that&rsquo;s all of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bennet winced. Beggars mustn&rsquo;t be choosers, said he, feebly,
      in his sad heart, and he thankfully took the broken victuals Jacob Van
      Boozenberg threw him. But he advised Gabriel, as we saw, to try Lawrence
      Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt agreed with Mr. Van Boozenberg that it was very warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heerd about you to Saratogy last summer, Mrs. Newt; but you ain&rsquo;t
      been to see ma since you come home. &lsquo;Ma,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;why
      don&rsquo;t Mrs. Newt call and see us?&rsquo; &lsquo;Law, pa,&rsquo; sez
      she, &lsquo;Mrs. Newt can&rsquo;t call and see such folks as we be!&rsquo;
      sez she. &lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t fine enough for Mrs. Newt,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      said the great man of Wall Street, and he laughed aloud at the excellent
      joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Van Boozenberg is very much mistaken,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
      Newt, anxiously. &ldquo;I am afraid she did not get my card. I am very
      sorry. But I hope you will tell her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Jacob knew perfectly well that Mrs. Newt had called, but he
      liked to show himself how vast his power was. He liked to see fine ladies
      in splendid drawing-rooms bowing, down before his ungrammatical throne,
      and metaphorically kissing his knobby red hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son, Abel, seems to enjoy himself werry well, Mrs. Newt,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Van Boozenberg, as he observed that youth, in sumptuous array,
      dancing devotedly with Mrs. Bleecker Van Kraut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Newt. &ldquo;But you know what
      young sons are, Mr. Van Boozenberg.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was setting precisely as that gentleman wished, and as he
      had intended to direct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, yes, Mrs. Newt! Ma sez to me, &lsquo;Pa, what a boy Corlear
      is! how he does spend money!&rsquo; And I sez to ma, &lsquo;Ma, he do.&rsquo;
      Tut, tut! The bills. I have to pay for that bay&mdash;! I s&rsquo;pose,
      now, your Abel don&rsquo;t lay up no money&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Van Boozenberg laughed again, and Mrs. Newt joined, but in a low and
      rather distressed way, as if it were necessary to laugh, although nothing
      funny had been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s positively dreadful the way he spends money,&rdquo;
      replied she. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where it will end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ho! it&rsquo;s the way with all young men, marm. I always sez to
      ma she needn&rsquo;t fret her gizzard. Young men will sow their wild oats.
      Oh, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;. Mr. Newt knows that werry well.
      Every man do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched Mrs. Newt&rsquo;s expression as he spoke. She answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that; but Mr. Newt shakes his head
      dismally nowadays about something or other, and he&rsquo;s really grown
      old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In uttering these words Mrs. Newt had sealed the fate of a large offering
      for discount made that very day by Boniface Newt, Son, &amp; Co.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; ANOTHER TURN IN THE WALTZ.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The music streamed through the rooms in the soft, yearning, lingering,
      passionate, persuasive measures of a waltz. Arthur Merlin had been very
      intently watching Hope Wayne, because he saw Abel Newt approaching with
      Mrs. Van Kraut, and he wished to catch the first look of Hope upon seeing
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bleecker Van Kraut, when she waltzed, was simply a circular
      advertisement of the Van Kraut property. Her slow rising and falling
      motion displayed the family jewels to the utmost advantage. The same
      insolent smoothness and finish prevailed in the whole performance. It was
      almost as perfect as the Paris toys which you wind up, and which spin
      smoothly round upon the table. Abel Newt, conscious master of the dance
      and chief of brilliant youth, waltzed with an air of delicate deference
      toward his partner, and, gay defiance toward the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performance was so novel and so well executed that the ball instantly
      became a spectacle of which Abel and Mrs. Van Kraut were the central
      figures. The crowd pressed around them, and Abel gently pushed them back
      in his fluctuating circles. Short ladies in the back-ground stood upon
      chairs for a moment to get a better view; while Mrs. Dagon and Mrs. Orry,
      whom no dexterous waltzer would ever clasp in the dizzy whirl, spattered
      their neighborhood with epithets of contempt and indignation, thanking
      Heaven that in their day things had not quite come to such a pass as that.
      Colonel Burr himself, my dears, never dared to touch more than the tips of
      his partner&rsquo;s fingers in the contra-dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne had not met Abel Newt since they had parted after the runaway
      at Delafield, except in his mother&rsquo;s conservatory, and when she was
      stepping from the carriage. In the mean while she had been learning every
      thing at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her eyes fell upon him now she remembered that day upon the lawn at
      Pinewood, when he stood suddenly beside her, casting a shadow upon the
      page she was reading. The handsome boy had grown into this proud, gallant,
      gay young man, surrounded by that social prestige which gives graceful
      confidence to the bearing of any man. He knew that Hope had heard of his
      social success; but he could not justly estimate its effect upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all those who stood by her Arthur Merlin was the only one who knew that
      she had ever known Abel, and Arthur only inferred it from Abel&rsquo;s
      resemblance to the sketch of Manfred, which had evidently deeply affected
      Hope. Lawrence Newt, who knew Delafield, had wondered if Abel and Hope had
      ever met. Perhaps he had a little fear of their meeting, knowing Abel to
      be audacious and brilliant, and Hope to be romantic. Perhaps the anxiety
      with which he now looked upon the waltz arose from the apprehension that
      Hope could not help, at least, fancying such a handsome fellow. And then&mdash;what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring certainly did not know, although Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s eyes
      seemed to ask hers the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope heard the music, and her heart beat time. As she saw Abel and
      remembered the days that were no more, for a moment her cheek flushed&mdash;not
      tumultuously, but gently&mdash;and Lawrence Newt and the painter remarked
      it. The emotion passed, almost imperceptibly, and her eyes followed the
      dancers calmly, with only a little ache in the heart&mdash;with only a
      vague feeling that she had lived a long, long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt had not lost Hope Wayne from his attention for a single moment
      during the evening; and before the interest in the dance was palled,
      before people had begun to buzz again and turn away, while Mrs. Van Kraut
      and he were still the spectacle upon which all eyes were directed, he
      suddenly whirled his partner toward the spot where Hope Wayne and her
      friends were standing, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no more necessary for Mrs. Van Kraut to fan herself than if she had
      been a marble statue. But it is proper to fan one&rsquo;s self when one
      has done dancing&mdash;so she waved the fan. Besides, it was a Van Kraut
      heir-loom. It came from Amsterdam. It was studded with jewels. It was part
      of the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Abel, he turned and bowed profoundly to Miss Wayne. Of course she
      knew that people were looking. She bowed as if to a mere acquaintance.
      Abel said a few words, signifying nothing, to his partner, then he
      remarked to Miss Wayne that he was very glad indeed to meet her again;
      that he had not called because he knew she had been making a convent of
      her aunt&rsquo;s house&mdash;making herself a nun&mdash;a Sister of
      Charity, he did not doubt, doing good as she always did&mdash;making every
      body in the world happy, as she could not help doing, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel rattled on, he did not know why; but he did know that his Uncle
      Lawrence, and Amy Waring, and Mr. Merlin heard every thing he said. Hope
      looked at him calmly, and listened to the gay cascade of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music was still playing; Mr. Van Boozenberg spoke to Lawrence Newt;
      Amy Waring said that she saw her Aunt Bennet. Would Mr. Merlin take her to
      her aunt?&mdash;he should return to his worship in one moment. Mr. Merlin
      was very gallant, and replied with spirit that when her worship returned&mdash;here
      he made a low bow&mdash;his would. As they moved away Amy Waring laughed
      at him, and said that men would compliment as long as&mdash;as women are
      lovely, interpolated Mr. Merlin. Arthur also wished to know what speech
      was good for, if not to say the sweetest things; and so they were lost to
      view, still gayly chatting with the pleasant freedom of a young man and
      woman who know that they are not in love with each other, and are
      perfectly content not to be so, because&mdash;whether they know it or not&mdash;they
      are each in love with somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      This movement had taken place as Abel was finishing his scattering volley
      of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, as he saw that he was not overheard, and
      sinking his voice into that tone of tender music which Hope so well
      remembered&mdash;&ldquo;yes, making every body in the world happy but one
      person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His airy persiflage had not pleased Hope Wayne. The sudden modulation into
      sentiment offended her. Before she replied&mdash;indeed she had no
      intention of replying&mdash;the round eyes of Mrs. Van Kraut informed her
      partner that she was ready for another turn, and forth they whirled upon
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jes&rsquo; sez to Mrs. Dagon, you know, ma&rsquo;am, sez I, I don&rsquo;t
      like to see a young man like Mr. Abel Newt, sez I, wasting himself upon
      married women. No, sez I, ma&rsquo;am, when you women have made your
      market, sez I, you oughter stan&rsquo; one side and give the t&rsquo;others
      a chance, sez I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Van Boozenberg addressed this remark to Lawrence Newt. In the eyes of
      the old gentleman it was another instance of imprudence on Abel&rsquo;s
      part not to be already engaged to some rich girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt replied by looking round the room as if searching for some
      one, and then saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see your daughter, Mrs. Witchet, here to-night, Mr.
      Van Boozenberg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; growled the papa, and moved on to talk with Mrs. Dagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sir,&rdquo; said the Honorable Budlong Dinks, approaching
      just as Lawrence Newt finished his remark, and Van Boozenberg, growling,
      departed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an unfortunate observation. You are, perhaps, not aware&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! thank you, yes, I am fully aware,&rdquo; replied Lawrence Newt.
      &ldquo;But one thing I do not know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Budlong Dinks bowed with dignity as if he understood Mr.
      Newt to compliment him by insinuating that he was the man who knew all
      about it, and would immediately enlighten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know why, if a man does a mean and unfeeling, yes, an
      inhuman act, it is bad manners to speak of it. Old Van Boozenberg ought to
      be sent to the penitentiary for his treatment of his daughter, and we all
      know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but really,&rdquo; replied the Honorable Budlong Dinks,
      &ldquo;really&mdash;you know&mdash;it would be impossible. Mr. Van
      Boozenberg is a highly respectable man&mdash;really&mdash;we should lapse
      into chaos,&rdquo; and the honorable gentleman rubbed his hands with
      perfect suavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did we emerge?&rdquo; asked Lawrence Newt, with such a kindly
      glimmer in his eyes, that Mr. Dinks said merely, &ldquo;really,&rdquo; and
      moved on, remarking to General Arcularius Belch, with a diplomatic shrug,
      that Lawrence Newt was a very odd man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd, but not without the coin. He can afford to be odd,&rdquo;
      replied that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these little things were said and done, Lawrence moved through the
      crowd and somehow found himself at the side of Amy Waring, who was talking
      with Fanny Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young Napoleon,&rdquo; said Lawrence to his niece as he joined
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, you droll Uncle Lawrence?&rdquo; demanded Fanny,
      her eyes glittering with inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mrs. Wurmser&mdash;I mean Mrs. Dinks?&rdquo;
      continued Lawrence. &ldquo;Why, when I saw you talking together a little
      while ago, I could think of nothing but the young Bonaparte and the old
      Wurmser.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You droll Uncle Lawrence, aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an astuter young Napoleon than Uncle Lawrence knew. Even then and
      there, in Mrs. Kingfisher&rsquo;s ball-room, had Fanny Newt resolved how
      to carry her Mantua by a sudden coup.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; HEAVEN&rsquo;S LAST BEST GIFT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Alfred, I am glad to see you. You may kiss me&mdash;carefully,
      carefully!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alfred Dinks therewith kissed lips upon his return from Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Alfred, my dear, I wish to speak to you,&rdquo; said
      Fanny Newt, with even more than her usual decision. The eyes were
      extremely round and black. Alfred seated himself with vague trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, we must be married immediately,&rdquo; remarked Fanny,
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the lover shone with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Fanny!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you told mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered she, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but then you know&mdash;&rdquo; rejoined Alfred. He would
      have said more, but he was afraid. He wanted to inquire whether Fanny
      thought that her father would supply the sinews of matrimony. Alfred&rsquo;s
      theory was that he undoubtedly would. He was sure that a young woman of
      Fanny&rsquo;s calmness, intrepidity, and profound knowledge of the world
      would not propose immediate matrimony without seeing how the commissariat
      was to be supplied. She has all her plans laid, of course, thought he&mdash;she
      is so talented and cool that &lsquo;tis all right, I dare say. Of course
      she knows that I have nothing, and hope for nothing except from old Burt,
      and he&rsquo;s not sure for me, by any means. But Boniface Newt is rich
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Alfred consoled himself by thinking of the style in which that worthy
      commission merchant lived, and especially of his son Abel&rsquo;s expense
      and splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, dear&mdash;just try not to be trying, you know, but think
      what you are about. Your mother has found out that something has gone
      wrong&mdash;that you are not engaged to Hope Wayne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I know,&rdquo; burst in Alfred; &ldquo;she treated
      me like a porcupine this morning&mdash;or ant-eater, which is it, Fanny&mdash;the
      thing with quills, you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fanny Newt patted the floor with her foot. Alfred continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and Hope sent down, and she wanted to see me alone some time
      to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s foot stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred, dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are a good fellow, but
      you are too amiable. You must do just as I want you to, dearest, or
      something awful will happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Fanny; nothing shall happen. I love you like any thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smack! smack!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, listen, Alfred! Your mother doesn&rsquo;t like me. She
      would do any thing to prevent your marrying me. The reasons I will tell
      you at another time. If you go home and talk with her and Hope Wayne, you
      can not help betraying that you are engaged to me; and&mdash;you know your
      mother, Alfred&mdash;she would openly oppose the marriage, and I don&rsquo;t
      know what she might not say to my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny spoke clearly and rapidly, but calmly. Alfred looked utterly
      bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said he, feebly.
      &ldquo;What do you think we had better do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be married, Alfred, dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but when, Fanny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Fanny, firmly, and putting out her hand to her
      beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized it mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, Fanny?&rdquo; asked he, after a pause of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dear&mdash;to-day. I am as ready now as I shall be a
      year hence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will my mother say?&rdquo; inquired Alfred, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be too late for her to say any thing. Don&rsquo;t you see,
      Alfred, dear!&rdquo; continued Fanny, in a most assuring tone, &ldquo;that
      if we go to your mother and say, &lsquo;Here we are, married!&rsquo; she
      has sense enough to perceive that nothing can be done; and after a little
      while all will be smooth again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover was comforted by this view. He was even pleased by the audacity
      of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear, Fanny,&rdquo; said he, at length, in a more cheerful and
      composed voice, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s rather a good idea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is, dear. Are you ready?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred gasped a little at the prompt question, despite his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Fanny, you don&rsquo;t mean actually now&mdash;this very day?
      Gracious!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not now? Since we think best to be married immediately and in
      private, why should we put it off until to-night, or next week, when we
      are both as ready now as we can be then?&rdquo; asked Fanny, quietly;
      &ldquo;especially as something may happen to make it impossible then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Dinks shut his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will your father say?&rdquo; he inquired, at length, without
      raising his eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see he will have to make up his mind to it, just as your
      mother will?&rdquo; replied Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my father!&rdquo; said Alfred, in a state of temporary
      blindness continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and your father too,&rdquo; answered Fanny, both she and
      Alfred treating the Honorable Budlong Dinks as a mere tender to that
      woman-of-war his wife, in a way that would have been incredible to a
      statesman who considered his wife a mere domestic luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence of several minutes. Then Mr. Dinks opened his eyes,
      and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Alfred, dear!&rdquo; and Fanny leaned toward him, with her
      head poised like that of a black snake. Alfred was fascinated. Perhaps he
      was sorry he was so; perhaps he wanted to struggle. But he did not. He was
      under the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still a lingering silence. Fanny waited patiently. At length she
      asked again, putting her hand in her lover&rsquo;s:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Alfred, in a crisp, resolute tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny raised her hand and rang the bell. The waiter appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, I want a carriage immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, John, tell Mary to bring me my things. I am going out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo; And hearing nothing farther, John disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps a judicious instinct which taught Fanny not to leave Alfred
      alone by going up to array herself in her own chamber. The intervals of
      delay between the coming of the maid and the coming of the carriage the
      young woman employed in conversing dexterously about Boston, and the
      friends he had seen there, and in describing to him the great Kingfisher
      ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she was bonneted and cloaked, and the carriage was at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her home had not been a Paradise to Fanny Newt&mdash;nor were Aunt Dagon,
      Papa and Mamma Newt, and brother Abel altogether angels. She had no
      superfluous emotions of any kind at any time; but as she passed through
      the hall she saw her sister May&mdash;the youngest child&mdash;a girl of
      sixteen&mdash;Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s favorite&mdash;standing upon the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing; the hall was quite dim, and as the girl stood in the
      half light her childlike, delicate beauty seemed to Fanny more striking
      than ever. If Uncle Lawrence had seen her at the moment he would have
      thought of Jacob&rsquo;s ladder and the angels ascending and descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, May!&rdquo; said Fanny, going up to her sister, taking her
      face between her hands and kissing her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters looked at each other, each inexplicably conscious that it was
      not an ordinary farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, darling!&rdquo; said Fanny, kissing her again, and still
      holding her young, lovely face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched and surprised by the unwonted tenderness of her sister&rsquo;s
      manner, May threw her arms around her neck and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Fanny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny did not disengage the arms that clung about her, nor raise the young
      head that rested upon her shoulder. Perhaps she felt that somehow it was a
      benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      May raised her head at length, kissed Fanny gently upon the lips, smoothed
      her black hair for a moment with her delicate hand, half smiled through
      her tears as she thought that after this indication of affection she
      should have such a pleasant intercourse with her sister, and then pushed
      her softly away, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dinks is waiting for you, Fanny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny said nothing, but drew her veil over her face, and Mr. Dinks handed
      her into the carriage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; MOTHER-IN-LAW AND DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks and Hope Wayne sat together in their lodgings, waiting
      impatiently for Alfred&rsquo;s return. They were both working busily, and
      said little to each other. Mrs. Dinks had resolved to leave New York at
      the earliest possible moment. She waited only to have a clear explanation
      with her son. Hope Wayne was also waiting for an explanation. She was
      painfully curious to know why Alfred Dinks had told his mother that they
      were engaged. As her Aunt Dinks looked at her, and saw how noble and lofty
      her beauty was, yet how simple and candid, she was more than ever angry
      with her, because she felt that it was impossible she should ever have
      loved Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard a carriage in the street. It stopped at the door. In a moment
      the sound of a footstep was audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I wish to speak to Alfred alone. I hear his step,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, aunt,&rdquo; answered Hope Wayne, rising, and taking her
      little basket she moved toward the door. Just as she reached it, it
      opened, and Alfred Dinks and Fanny Newt entered. Hope bowed, and was
      passing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Hope!&rdquo; whispered Alfred, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned at the door and looked at her cousin, who, with uncertain
      bravado, advanced with Fanny to his mother, who was gazing at them in
      amazement, and said, in a thick, hurried voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, this is your daughter Fanny&mdash;my wife&mdash;Mrs. Alfred
      Dinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she heard these words Hope Wayne went out, closing the door behind her,
      leaving the mother alone with her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks sat speechless in her chair for a few moments, staring at
      Alfred, who looked as if his legs would not long support him, and at
      Fanny, who stood calmly beside him. At length she said to Alfred,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that woman really your wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;m,&rdquo; replied the new husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to support her with?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my allowance,&rdquo; said Alfred, in a very small voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Alfred Dinks, your husband&rsquo;s allowance is six hundred
      dollars a year from his father. I wish you joy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sarcastic sparkle in her eyes. Mrs. Dinks had long felt that
      she and Fanny were contesting a prize. At this moment, while she knew that
      she had not won, she was sure that Fanny had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was prepared for such a reception. She did not shrink. She
      remembered the great Burt fortune. But before she could speak Mrs. Dinks
      rose, and, with an air of contemptuous defiance, inquired,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you living, Mrs. Dinks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alfred looked at his wife in profound perplexity. He thought, for his
      part, that he was living in that very house. But his wife answered,
      quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are at Bunker&rsquo;s, where we shall be delighted to see you.
      Good-morning, Mrs. Dinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Fanny took her husband by the arm and went out, having entirely
      confounded her mother-in-law, who meant to have wished her children
      good-morning, and then have left them to their embarrassment. But victory
      seemed to perch upon Fanny&rsquo;s standards along the whole line.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; THE BACK WINDOW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was not unmindful of the difference of age between Amy
      Waring and himself; and instinctively he did nothing which could show to
      others that he felt more for her than for a friend. Younger men, who could
      not help yielding to the charm of her presence, never complained of him.
      He was never &ldquo;that infernal old bore, Lawrence Newt,&rdquo; to them.
      More than one of them, in the ardor of young feeling, had confided his
      passion to Lawrence, who said to him, bravely, &ldquo;My dear fellow, I do
      not wonder you feel so. God speed you&mdash;and so will I, all I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did so. He mentioned the candidate kindly to Miss Waring. He
      repeated little anecdotes that he had heard to his advantage. Lawrence
      regarded the poor suitor as a painter does a picture. He took him up in
      the arms of his charity and moved him round and round. He put him upon his
      sympathy as upon an easel, and turned on the kindly lights and judiciously
      darkened the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His generosity was chivalric, but it was unavailing. Beautiful flowers
      arrived from the aspiring youths. They were so lovely, so fragrant! What
      taste that young Hal Battlebury has! remarks Lawrence Newt, admiringly, as
      he smells the flowers that stand in a pretty vase upon the centre-table.
      Amy Waring smiles, and says that it is Thorburn&rsquo;s taste, of whom Mr.
      Battlebury buys the flowers. Mr. Newt replies that it is at least very
      thoughtful in him. A young lady can not but feel kindly, surely, toward
      young men who express their good feeling in the form of flowers. Then he
      dexterously leads the conversation into some other channel. He will not
      harm the cause of poor Mr. Battlebury by persisting in speaking of him and
      his bouquets, when that persistence will evidently render the subject a
      little tedious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Hal Battlebury, who, could he only survey the Waring mansion from
      the lower floor to the roof, would behold his handsome flowers that came
      on Wednesday withering in cold ceremony upon the parlor-table&mdash;and in
      Amy Waring&rsquo;s bureau-drawer would see the little book she received
      from &ldquo;her friend Lawrence Newt&rdquo; treasured like a priceless
      pearl, with a pressed rose laid upon the leaf where her name and his are
      written&mdash;a rose which Lawrence Newt playfully stole one evening from
      one of the ceremonious bouquets pining under its polite reception, and
      said gayly, as he took leave, &ldquo;Let this keep my memory fragrant till
      I return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a singular fact that when one of those baskets without a card
      arrived at the house, it was not left in superb solitary state upon the
      centre-table in the parlor, but bloomed as long as care could coax it in
      the strict seclusion of Miss Waring&rsquo;s own chamber, and then some
      choicest flower was selected to be pressed and preserved somewhere in the
      depths of the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could the bureau drawers give up their treasures, would any human being
      longer seem to be cold? would any maiden young or old appear a voluntary
      spinster, or any unmarried octogenarian at heart a bachelor?
    </p>
    <p>
      For many a long hour Lawrence Newt stood at the window of the loft in the
      rear of his office, and looked up at the window where he had seen Amy
      Waring that summer morning. He was certainly quite as curious about that
      room as Hope about his early knowledge of her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just run round and settle this matter,&rdquo; said the
      merchant to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not stir. His hands were in his pockets. He was standing as
      firmly in one spot as if he had taken root.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;upon the whole, I&rsquo;ll just run round,&rdquo; thought
      Lawrence, without the remotest approach to motion of any kind. But his
      fancy was running round all the time, and the fancies of men who watch
      windows, as Lawrence Newt watched this window, are strangely fantastic. He
      imagined every thing in that room. It was a woman with innumerable
      children, of course&mdash;some old nurse of Amy&rsquo;s&mdash;who had a
      kind of respectability to preserve, which intrusion would injure. No, no,
      by Heaven! it was Mrs. Tom Witchet, old Van Boozenberg&rsquo;s daughter!
      Of course it was. An old friend of Amy&rsquo;s, half-starving in that
      miserable lodging, and Amy her guardian angel. Lawrence Newt mentally
      vowed that Mrs. Tom Witchet should never want any thing. He would speak to
      Amy at the next meeting of the Round Table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or there were other strange fancies. What will not an India merchant dream
      as he gazes from his window? It was some old teacher of Amy&rsquo;s&mdash;some
      music-master, some French teacher&mdash;dying alone and in poverty, or
      with a large family. No, upon the whole, thought Lawrence Newt, he&rsquo;s
      not old enough to have a large family&mdash;he is not married&mdash;he has
      too delicate a nature to struggle with the world&mdash;he was a gentleman
      in his own country; and he has, of course, it&rsquo;s only natural&mdash;how
      could he possibly help it?&mdash;he has fallen in love with Miss Waring.
      These music-masters and Italian teachers are such silly fellows. I know
      all about it, thought Mr. Newt; and now he lies there forlorn, but
      picturesque and very handsome, singing sweetly to his guitar, and reciting
      Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnets with large, melancholy eyes. His manners refined
      and fascinating. His age? About thirty. Poor Amy! Of course common
      humanity requires her to come and see that he does not suffer. Of course
      he is desperately in love, and she can only pity. Pity? pity? Who says
      something about the kinship of pity? I really think, says Lawrence Newt to
      himself, that I ought to go over and help that unfortunate young man.
      Perhaps he wishes to return to his native country. I am sure he ought to.
      His native air will be balm to him. Yes, I&rsquo;ll ask Miss Waring about
      it this very evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not. He never alluded to the subject. They had never mentioned that
      summer noontide exchange of glance and gesture which had so curious an
      effect on Lawrence Newt that he now stood quite as often at his back
      window, looking up at the old brick house, as at his front window, looking
      out over the river and the ships, and counting the spires&mdash;at least
      it seemed so&mdash;in Brooklyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      For how could Lawrence know of the book that was kept in the bureau drawer&mdash;of
      the rose whose benediction lay forever fragrant upon those united names?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really sorry for Hal Battlebury,&rdquo; said the merchant to
      himself. &ldquo;He is such a good, noble fellow! I should have supposed
      that Miss Waring would have been so very happy with him. He is so suitable
      in every way; in age, in figure, in tastes&mdash;in sympathy altogether.
      Then he is so manly and modest, so simple and true. It is really very&mdash;very&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he mused, and asked and answered, and thought of Hal Battlebury and
      Amy Waring together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that if he were a younger man&mdash;about the age of
      Battlebury, say&mdash;full of hope, and faith, and earnest endeavor&mdash;a
      glowing and generous youth&mdash;it would be the very thing he should do&mdash;to
      fall in love with Amy Waring. How could any man see her and not love her?
      His reflections grew dreamy at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so lovely a girl did not return the affection of such a young
      man, it would be&mdash;of course, what else could it be?&mdash;it would be
      because she had deliberately made up her mind that, under no conceivable
      circumstances whatsoever, would she ever marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reached this satisfactory conclusion Lawrence Newt paced up and down
      before the window, with his hands still buried in his pockets, thinking of
      Hal Battlebury&mdash;thinking of the foreign youth with the large,
      melancholy eyes pining upon a bed of pain, and reciting Petrarch&rsquo;s
      sonnets, in the miserable room opposite&mdash;thinking also of that
      strange coldness of virgin hearts which not the ardors of youth and love
      could melt.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, stopping before the window, he thought of his own boyhood&mdash;of
      the first wild passion of his young heart&mdash;of the little hand he held&mdash;of
      the soft darkness of eyes whose light mingled with his own&mdash;again the
      palm-trees&mdash;the rushing river&mdash;when, at the very window upon
      which he was unconsciously gazing, one afternoon a face appeared, with a
      black silk handkerchief twisted about the head, and looking down into the
      court between the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt stared at it without moving. Both windows were closed, nor
      was the woman at the other looking toward him. He had, indeed, scarcely
      seen her fully before she turned away. But he had recognized that face. He
      had seen a woman he had so long thought dead. In a moment Amy Waring&rsquo;s
      visit was explained, and a more heavenly light shone upon her character as
      he thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Amy dear!&rdquo; were the words that unconsciously
      stole to his lips; and going into the office, Lawrence Newt told Thomas
      Tray that he should not return that afternoon, wished his clerks good-day,
      and hurried around the corner into Front Street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. &mdash; ABEL NEWT, <i>vice</i> SLIGO MOULTRIE REMOVED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Plumers were at Bunker&rsquo;s. The gay, good-hearted Grace, full of
      fun and flirtation, vowed that New York was life, and all the rest of the
      world death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not compliment the South very much,&rdquo; said Sligo
      Moultrie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! The South is home, and we don&rsquo;t compliment relations,
      you know,&rdquo; returned Miss Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank Heaven! the South <i>is</i> home, Miss Grace. New York
      is like a foreign city. The tumult is fearful; yet it is only a sea-port
      after all. It has no metropolitan repose. It never can have. It is a
      trading town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I like trading towns, if that is it,&rdquo; returned Miss
      Grace, looking out into the bustling street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moultrie smiled&mdash;a quiet, refined, intelligent, and accomplished
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled confidently. Not offensively, but with that half-shy sense of
      superiority which gave the high grace of self-possession to his manner&mdash;a
      languid repose which pervaded his whole character. The symmetry of his
      person, the careless ease of his carriage, a sweet voice, a handsome face,
      were valuable allies of his intellectual accomplishments; and when all the
      forces were deployed they made Sligo Moultrie very fascinating. He was not
      audacious nor brilliant. It was a passive, not an active nature. He was
      not rich, although Mrs. Boniface Newt had a vague idea that every Southern
      youth was <i>ex-officio</i> a Croesus. Scion of a fine old family, like
      the Newts, and Whitloes, and Octoynes of New York, Mr. Sligo Moultrie,
      born to be a gentleman, but born poor, was resolved to maintain his state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grace Plumer, as we saw at Mrs. Boniface Newt&rsquo;s, had bright
      black eyes, profusely curling black hair, olive skin, pouting mouth, and
      pearly teeth. Very rich, very pretty, and very merry was Miss Grace
      Plumer, who believed with enthusiastic faith that life was a ball, but who
      was very shrewd and very kindly also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie understood distinctly why he was sitting at the window with
      Grace Plumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The roses are in bloom at your home, I suppose, Miss Grace?&rdquo;
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose they are, and a dreadfully lonely time they&rsquo;re
      having of it. Southern life, of course, is a hundred times better than
      life here; but it is a little lonely, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Moultrie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace said this turning her neck slightly, and looking an arch
      interrogatory at her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is lonely in some ways. But then there is so much going up
      to town and travelling that, after all, it is only a few months that we
      are at home; and a man ought to be at home a good deal&mdash;he ought not
      to be a vagabond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Grace, bowing mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said &lsquo;a man,&rsquo; you observe, Miss Grace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man includes woman, I believe, Mr. Moultrie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two cases&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he holds her in his arms or in his heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a sudden volley masked in music. Grace Plumer was charmed. She
      looked at her companion. He had been &ldquo;a vagabond&rdquo; all winter
      in New York; but there were few more presentable men. Moreover, she felt
      at home with him as a <i>compatriot</i>. Yes, this would do very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grace Plumer had scarcely mentally installed Mr. Sligo Moultrie as
      first flirter in her corps, when a face she remembered looked up at the
      window from the street, more dangerous even than when she had seen it in
      the spring. It was the face of Abel Newt, who raised his hat and bowed to
      her with an admiration which he concealed that he took care to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he was in the room, perfectly <i>comme il faut</i>,
      sparkling, resistless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Plumer, I knew spring was coming. I felt it as I
      approached Bunker&rsquo;s. I said to Herbert Octoyne (he&rsquo;s off with
      the Shrimp; Papa Shrimp was too much, he was so old that he was rank)&mdash;I
      said, either I smell the grass sprouting in the Battery or I have a
      sensation of spring. I raise my eyes&mdash;I see that it is not grass, but
      flowers. I recognize the dear, delicious spring. I bow to Miss Plumer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed it airily off. It was audacious. It would have been outrageous,
      except that the manner made it seem persiflage, and therefore allowable.
      Grace Plumer blushed, bowed, smiled, and met his offered hand half-way.
      Abel Newt knew perfectly what he was doing, and raised it respectfully,
      bowed over it, kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moultrie, glad to see you. Miss Plumer, &lsquo;tis astonishing how
      this man always knows the pleasant places. If I want to know where the
      best fruits and the earliest flowers are, I ask Sligo Moultrie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moultrie bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first rose of the year blooms in Mr. Moultrie&rsquo;s
      button-hole,&rdquo; continued Abel, who galloped on, laughing, and seating
      himself upon an ottoman, so that his eyes were lower than the level of
      Grace Plumer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and joined the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He talks nothing but &lsquo;ladies&rsquo; delights,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;two other things, please, Miss Grace,&rdquo; said
      Moultrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Mr. Moultrie, two other cases? You always have two more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better two more than too much,&rdquo; struck in Abel, who saw that
      Miss Plumer had put out her darling little foot from beneath her dress,
      and therefore had fixed his eyes upon it, with an admiration which was not
      lost upon the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Moultrie, laughing and looking at them.
      &ldquo;You are both two more and too much for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, good, good for Moultrie!&rdquo; applauded Abel; &ldquo;and
      now, Miss Plumer, I submit that he has the floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Moultrie. What are the two other things that you
      talk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pansies and rosemary,&rdquo; said the young man, rising and bowing
      himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Plumer, you have been the inspiration of my friend Sligo, who
      was never so brilliant in his life before. How generous in you to rise and
      shine on this wretched town! It is Sahara. Miss Plumer descends upon it
      like dew. Where have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home, in Louisiana.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes. Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle&mdash;I have
      never been there; but it comes to me here when you come, Miss Plumer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the slight persiflage to cover the audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, Mr. Newt, I have the honor of seeing the gentleman of whom
      I have heard most this winter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will not our enemies say of us, Miss Plumer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no enemies,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;except, perhaps&mdash;no,
      I&rsquo;ll not mention them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? who? I insist,&rdquo; said Abel, looking at Grace Plumer
      earnestly for a moment, then dropping his eyes upon her very pretty and
      very be-ringed white hands, where the eyes lingered a little and
      worshipped in the most evident manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except, then, your own sex,&rdquo; said the little Louisianian,
      half blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do them no harm,&rdquo; replied Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you make them jealous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealous of what?&rdquo; returned the young man, in a lower tone,
      and more seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s only of&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;of what I hear from
      the girls,&rdquo; said Grace, fluttering a little, as she remembered the
      conservatory at Mrs. Boniface Newt&rsquo;s, which also Abel had not
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you hear, Miss Grace?&rdquo; he asked, in pure music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace blushed, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! only of your success with poor, feeble women,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no success with women,&rdquo; returned Abel Newt, in a
      half-serious way, and in his most melodious voice. &ldquo;Women are
      naturally generous. They appreciate and acknowledge an honest admiration,
      even when it is only honest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only honest! What more could it be, Mr. Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be eloquent. It might be fascinating and irresistible.
      Even when a man does not really admire, his eloquence makes him dangerous.
      If, when he truly admires, he were also eloquent, he would be
      irresistible. There is no victory like that. I should envy Alexander
      nothing and Napoleon nothing if I thought I could really conquer one woman&rsquo;s
      heart. My very consciousness of the worth of the prize paralyzes my
      efforts. It is musty, but it is true, that fools rush in where angels fear
      to tread.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat silent, gazing abstractedly at the two lovely feet of Miss Grace
      Plumer, with an air that implied how far his mind had wandered in their
      conversation from any merely personal considerations. Miss Grace Plumer
      had not made as much progress as Mr. Newt since their last meeting. Abel
      Newt seemed to her the handsomest fellow she had ever seen. What he had
      said both piqued and pleased her. It pleased her because it piqued her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are naturally noble,&rdquo; he continued, in a low, rippling
      voice. &ldquo;If they see that a man sincerely admires them they forgive
      him, although he can not say so. Yes, and a woman who really loves a man
      forgives him every thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her hands, which lay white, and warm, and glittering in
      her lap. She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a superb ruby, Miss Grace! It might be a dew-drop from a
      pomegranate in Paradise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at the extravagant conceit, while he took her hand as he spoke,
      and admired the ring. The white, warm hand remained passive in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me come nearer to Paradise,&rdquo; he said, half-abstractedly,
      as if he were following his own thoughts, and he pressed his lips to the
      fingers upon which the ruby gleamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grace Plumer was almost frightened. This was a very different
      performance from Mr. Sligo Moultrie&rsquo;s&mdash;very different from any
      she had known. She felt as if she suggested, in some indescribable way,
      strange and beautiful thoughts to Abel Newt. He looked and spoke as if he
      addressed himself to the thoughts she had evoked rather than to herself.
      Yet she felt herself to be both the cause and the substance. It was very
      sweet. She did not know what she felt; she did not know how much she
      dared. But when he went away she knew that Abel Newt was appointed first
      flirter, <i>vice</i> Sligo Moultrie removed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. &mdash; THE DAY AFTER THE WEDDING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 23d instant, Alfred Dinks, Esq., of Boston, to Fanny, oldest
      daughter of Boniface Newt, Esq., of this city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny wrote the notice with her own hands, and made Alfred take it to the
      papers. In this manner she was before her mother-in-law in spreading the
      news. In this manner, also, as Boniface Newt, Esq., sat at breakfast, he
      learned of his daughter&rsquo;s marriage. His face grew purple. He looked
      apoplectic as he said to his wife,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, what in God&rsquo;s name does this mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His frightened wife asked what, and he read the announcement aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from table, and walked up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know any thing of this?&rdquo; inquired he. &ldquo;What
      does it mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I thought he was engaged to Hope Wayne,&rdquo; replied
      Mrs. Newt, crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Then Mr. Newt said, with a sneer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that a mother whose, daughter gets married without
      her knowledge is a very curious kind of mother&mdash;an extremely
      competent kind of mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his walking. Mrs. Newt went on with her weeping. But Boniface
      Newt was aware of the possibilities in the case of Alfred, and therefore
      tried to recover himself and consider the chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about this fellow?&rdquo; said he, petulantly, to
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any thing in particular,&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know whether he has money, or whether his father has?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but old Mr. Burt is his grandfather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! his mother&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so. I know Fanny always said he was Hope Wayne&rsquo;s
      cousin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt pondered for a little while. His brow contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth have they run away? Did Mr. Burt&rsquo;s grandson
      suppose he would be unwelcome to me? Has he been in the habit of coming
      here, Nancy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen them since this thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied the mother, bursting into tears afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband looked at her darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blubber. What good does crying do? G&mdash;! if any
      thing happens in this world, a woman falls to crying her eyes out, as if
      that would help it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Boniface Newt was not usually affectionate. But there was almost a
      ferocity in his address at this moment which startled his wife into
      silence. His daughter May turned pale as she saw and heard her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Abel was trial enough!&rdquo; said he, bitterly; &ldquo;and
      now the girl must fall to cutting up shines. I tell you plainly, Nancy, if
      Fanny has married a beggar, a beggar she shall be. There is some reason
      for a private marriage that we don&rsquo;t understand. It can&rsquo;t be
      any good reason; and, daughter or no daughter, she shall lie in the bed
      she has made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He scowled and set his teeth as he said it. His wife did not dare to cry
      any more. May went to her mother and took her hand, while the father of
      the family walked rapidly up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing comes at once,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Just as I am most
      bothered and driven down town, this infernal business of Fanny&rsquo;s
      must needs happen. One thing I&rsquo;m sure of&mdash;if it was all right
      it would not be a private wedding. What fools women are! And Fanny, whom I
      always thought so entirely able to take care of herself, turns out to be
      the greatest fool of all! This fellow&rsquo;s a booby, I believe, Mrs.
      Newt. I think I have heard even you make fun of him. But to be poor, too!
      To run away with a pauper-booby, by Heavens, it&rsquo;s too absurd!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt laughed mockingly, while the tears flowed fast from the eyes of
      his wife, who said at intervals, &ldquo;I vow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I
      declare,&rdquo; with such utter weakness of tone and movement that her
      husband suddenly exclaimed, in an exasperated tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, if you don&rsquo;t stop rocking your body in that inane way,
      and shaking your hand and your handkerchief, and saying those imbecile
      things, I shall go mad. I suppose this is the kind of sympathy a man gets
      from a woman in his misfortunes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May Newt looked shocked and indignant. &ldquo;Mother, I am sorry for poor
      Fanny,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it quietly and tenderly, and without the remotest reference in
      look, or tone, or gesture to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned toward her suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Miss!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, I shall go and see Fanny to-day,&rdquo; May continued, as if
      her father had not spoken. Her mother looked frightened, and turned to her
      deprecatingly with a look that said, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
      Her father regarded her for a moment in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, you little vixen? Let me catch you disobeying me
      and going to see that ungrateful wicked girl, if you think fit!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment in which May Newt turned pale, but she said, in a very
      low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May, I forbid your going,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt, severely and
      loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you have no right to forbid me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid your going,&rdquo; roared her father, planting himself in
      front of her, and quite white with wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      May said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty family you have brought up, Mrs. Nancy Newt,&rdquo; said
      he, at length, looking at his wife with all the contempt which his voice
      expressed. &ldquo;A son who ruins me by his extravagance, a daughter who
      runs away with&mdash;with&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated to remember the exact
      expression&mdash;&ldquo;with a pauper-booby, and another daughter who
      defies and disobeys her father. I congratulate you upon your charming
      family, upon your distinguished success, Mrs. Newt. Is there no younger
      brother of your son-in-law whom you might introduce to Miss May Newt? I
      beg your pardon, she is Miss Newt, now that her sister is so happily
      married,&rdquo; said Boniface Newt, bowing ceremoniously to his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt clasped her hands in an utterly helpless despair, and
      unconsciously raised them in a beseeching attitude before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The husband&rsquo;s duty takes him away from home,&rdquo; continued
      Mr. Newt. &ldquo;While he is struggling for the maintenance of his family
      he supposes that his wife is caring for his children, and that she has, at
      least, the smallest speck of an idea of what is necessary to be done to
      make them tolerably well behaved. Some husbands are doomed to be mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Boniface Newt bowed, and smiled sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and as if it were not enough to have my wife such a model
      trainer&mdash;and my son so careful&mdash;and my daughter so obedient&mdash;and
      my younger daughter so affectionate&mdash;I must also have trials in my
      business. I expected a great loan from Van Boozenberg&rsquo;s bank, and I
      haven&rsquo;t got it. He&rsquo;s an old driveling fool. Mrs. Newt, you
      must curtail expenses. There&rsquo;s one mouth less, and one Stewart&rsquo;s
      bill less, at any rate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said May, as if she could not bear the cool cutting
      adrift of her sister from the family, &ldquo;Fanny is not dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied her father, sullenly. &ldquo;No, the more&rsquo;s
      the&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, for he caught May&rsquo;s eye, and he could not finish the
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said his wife, at length, &ldquo;perhaps Alfred
      Dinks is not poor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the chance, but Mr. Newt was skeptical. He had an instinctive
      suspicion that no rich young man, however much a booby, would have married
      Fanny clandestinely. Men are forced to know something of their
      reputations, and Boniface Newt was perfectly aware that it was generally
      understood he had no aversion to money. He knew also that he was reputed
      rich, that his family were known to live expensively, and he was quite
      shrewd enough to believe that any youth in her own set who ran off with
      his daughter did so because he depended upon her father&rsquo;s money. He
      was satisfied that the Newt family was not to be a gainer by the new
      alliance. The more he thought of it the more he was convinced, and the
      more angry he became. He was still storming, when the door was thrown open
      and Mrs. Dagon rushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt stopped in his walk, smiled contemptuously, and pointed to his
      wife, who sat with her handkerchief over her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dagon, &ldquo;I knew &lsquo;twould come to
      this. I&rsquo;ve seen her hugging him the whole winter, and so has every
      body else who has eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she shook her plumage as she settled into a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Boniface Newt is unfortunately blind; that is to say, she sees
      every body&rsquo;s affairs but her own,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt, tauntingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon, without heeding him, talked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did they run away to be married? What does it mean? Fanny&rsquo;s
      not romantic, and Dinks is a fool. He&rsquo;s rich, and a proper match
      enough, for a woman can&rsquo;t expect to have every thing. I can&rsquo;t
      see why he didn&rsquo;t propose regularly, and behave like other people.
      Do you suppose he was actually engaged to his cousin Hope Wayne, and that
      our darling Fanny has outwitted the Boston beauty, and the Boston beau
      too, for that matter? It looks like it, really. I think that must be it.
      It&rsquo;s a pity a Newt should marry a fool&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the first time,&rdquo; interrupted her nephew, making a
      low bow to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon looked a little surprised. She had seen little jars and rubs
      before in the family, but this morning she seemed to have happened in upon
      an earthquake. She continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must make the best of it. Are they in the house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Aunt Dagon,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt. &ldquo;I knew nothing of it
      until, half an hour ago, I read it in the paper with all the rest of the
      world. It seems it was a family secret.&rdquo; And he bowed again to his
      wife,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; sobbed she. &ldquo;You know I didn&rsquo;t
      know any thing about it. Oh! Aunt Dagon, I never knew him so unjust and
      wicked as he is to-day. He treats me cruelly.&rdquo; And the poor woman
      covered her red eyes again with her handkerchief, and rocked herself
      feebly. Mr. Newt went out, and slammed the door behind him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. &mdash; A FIELD-DAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Nancy, tell me about this thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dagon, when
      the husband was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Nancy had nothing to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like his running away with her&mdash;that looks bad,&rdquo;
      continued Mrs. Dagon. She pondered a few moments, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you one thing, Nancy, which it wasn&rsquo;t worth while
      to mention to Boniface, who seems to be nervous this morning&mdash;but I
      am sure Fanny proposed the running off. Alfred Dinks is too great a fool.
      He never would have thought of it, and he would never have dared to do it
      if he had.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear me!&rdquo; responded Mrs. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! it isn&rsquo;t such a dreadful thing, if he is only rich
      enough,&rdquo; said Aunt Dagon, in a consoling voice. &ldquo;Every thing
      depends on that; and I haven&rsquo;t much doubt of it. Alfred Dinks is a
      fool, my dear, but Fanny Newt is not; and Fanny Newt is not the girl to
      marry a fool, except for reasons. You may trust Fanny, Nancy. You may
      depend there was some foolish something with Hope Wayne, on the part of
      Alfred, and Fanny has cut the knot she was not sure of untying. Pooh!
      pooh! When you are as old as I am you won&rsquo;t be distressed over these
      things. Fanny Newt is fully weaned. She wants an establishment, and she
      has got it. There are plenty of people who would have been glad to marry
      their daughters to Alfred Dinks. I can tell you there are some great
      advantages in having a fool for your husband. Don&rsquo;t you see Fanny
      never would have been happy with a man she couldn&rsquo;t manage. It&rsquo;s
      quite right, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the bell rang, and Mrs. Newt, not wishing to be caught with
      red eyes, called May, who had looked on at this debate, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mrs. Dagon had been so volubly talking she had also been busily
      thinking. She knew that if Alfred were a fool his mother was not&mdash;at
      least, not in the way she meant. There had been no love lost between the
      ladies, so that Mrs. Dagon was disposed to criticise the other&rsquo;s
      conduct very closely. She saw, therefore, that if Alfred Dinks were not
      rich&mdash;and it certainly was a question whether he were so really, or
      only in expectation from Mr. Burt&mdash;then also he might not be engaged
      to Hope Wayne. But the story of his wealth and his engagement might very
      easily have been the <i>ruse</i> by which the skillful Mrs. Dinks meant to
      conduct her campaign in New York. In that case, what was more likely than
      that she should have improved Fanny&rsquo;s evident delusion in regard to
      her son, and, by suggesting to him an elopement, have secured for him the
      daughter of a merchant so universally reputed wealthy as Boniface Newt?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon was clever&mdash;so was Mrs. Dinks; and it is the homage that
      one clever person always pays to another to believe the other capable of
      every thing that occurs to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of the marriage Mrs. Budlong Dinks had been defeated, but
      she was not dismayed. She had lost Hope Wayne, indeed, and she could no
      longer hope, by the marriage of Alfred with his cousin, to consolidate the
      Burt property in her family. She had been very indignant&mdash;very deeply
      disappointed. But she still loved her son, and the meditation of a night
      refreshed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a survey of the field, Mrs. Dinks felt that under no circumstances
      would Hope have married Alfred; and he had now actually married Fanny. So
      much was done. It was useless to wish impossible wishes. She did not
      desire her son to starve or come to social shame, although he had married
      Fanny; and Fanny, after all, was rather a belle, and the daughter of a
      rich merchant, who would have to support them. She knew, of course, that
      Fanny supposed her husband would share in the great Burt property. But as
      Mrs. Dinks herself believed the same thing, that did not surprise her. In
      fact, they would all be gainers by it; and nothing now remained but to
      devote herself to securing that result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step under the circumstances was clearly a visit to the Newts,
      and the ring which had sent Mrs. Newt from the room was Mrs. Dinks&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon was alone when Mrs. Dinks entered, and Mrs. Dagon was by no
      means sure, whatever she said to Nancy, that Mrs. Dinks had not outwitted
      them all. As she entered Mrs. Dagon put up her glasses and gazed at her;
      and when Mrs. Dinks saluted her, Mrs. Dagon bowed behind the glasses, as
      if she were bowing through a telescope at the planet Jupiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Dagon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Dinks!&rdquo; replied that lady, still
      contemplating the other as if she were a surprising and incomprehensible
      phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Profound silence followed. Mrs. Dinks was annoyed by the insult which Mrs.
      Dagon was tacitly putting upon her, and resolving upon revenge. Meanwhile
      she turned over some illustrated books upon the table, as if engravings
      were of all things those that afforded her the profoundest satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was conscious that she could not deceive Mrs. Dagon by an
      appearance of interest; so, after a few moments, Mrs. Dinks seated herself
      in a large easy-chair opposite that lady, who was still looking at her,
      shook her dress, glanced into the mirror with the utmost nonchalance, and
      finally, slowly drawing out her own glasses, raised them to her eyes, and
      with perfect indifference surveyed the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies gazed at each other for a few moments in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your daughter, Mrs. Alfred Dinks?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Dagon, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks continued to gaze without answering. She was resolved to put
      down this dragon that laid waste society. The dragon was instantly
      conscious that she had made a mistake in speaking, and was angry
      accordingly. She said nothing more; she only glared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, my dear Mrs. Dinks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Newt, in a
      troubled voice, as she entered the room. &ldquo;Oh my! isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it&mdash;singular?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs. Newt was bewildered. Between her husband and Mrs. Dagon she had
      been so depressed and comforted that she did not know what to think. She
      was sure it was Fanny who had married Alfred, and she supposed, with all
      the world, that he had, or was to have, a pretty fortune. Yet she felt,
      with her husband, that the private marriage was suspicious. It seemed, at
      least, to prove the indisposition of Mrs. Dinks to the match. But, as they
      were married, she did not wish to alienate the mother of the rich
      bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular, indeed, Mrs. Newt!&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Dinks; &ldquo;I
      call it extraordinary!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it outrageous,&rdquo; interpolated Mrs. Dagon. &ldquo;Poor
      girl! to be run away with and married! What a blow for our family!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks resumed her glasses, and looked unutterably at Mrs. Dagon. But
      Mrs. Dinks, on her side, knowing the limitations of Alfred&rsquo;s income,
      and believing in the Newt resources, did not wish to divert from him any
      kindness of the Newts. So she outgeneraled Mrs. Dagon again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, it is an outrage upon all our feelings. We must, of
      course, be mutually shocked at the indiscretion of these members of both
      our families.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh yes!&rdquo; answered Mrs. Newt. &ldquo;I do declare! what
      do people do so for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither cared to take the next step, and make the obvious and necessary
      inquiries as to the future, for neither wished to betray the thought that
      was uppermost. At length Mrs. Dinks ventured to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing, at least, is fortunate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Dagon behind the glasses, as if she
      scoffed at the bare suggestion of any thing but utter misfortune being
      associated with such an affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say one thing is fortunate,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Dinks, in a
      more decided tone, and without the slightest attention to Mrs. Dagon&rsquo;s
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I declare I don&rsquo;t see just what you mean, Mrs.
      Dinks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that they are neither of them children,&rdquo; answered the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may not be children,&rdquo; commenced Mrs. Dagon, in the most
      implacable tone, &ldquo;but they are both fools. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,
      Nancy, if they&rsquo;d both outwitted each other, after all; for whenever
      two people, without the slightest apparent reason, run away to be married,
      it is because one of them is poor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a truth of which the two mothers were both vaguely conscious, and
      which by no means increased the comfort of the situation. It led to a long
      pause in the conversation. Mrs. Dinks wished Aunt Dagon on the top of Mont
      Blanc, and while she was meditating the best thing to say, Mrs. Dagon, who
      had rallied, returned to the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that is something that would
      hardly be said of the daughter of Boniface Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Dagon resumed the study of Mrs. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or of the grand-nephew of Christopher Burt,&rdquo; said the latter,
      putting up her own glasses and returning the stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand-nephew! Is Alfred Dinks not the grandson of Mr. Burt?&rdquo;
      asked Mrs. Newt, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is his grand-nephew. I am the niece of Mr. Burt&mdash;daughter
      of his brother Jonathan, deceased,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Newt, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a very near relation,&rdquo; added Mrs. Dagon. &ldquo;Grand-nephews
      don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That might be true, but it was thin consolation for Mrs. Newt, who began
      to take fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mrs. Dinks, how did this affair come about?&rdquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; chimed in Aunt Dagon; &ldquo;how did it come about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Newt,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dinks, entirely overlooking
      the existence of Mrs. Dagon, &ldquo;you know my son Alfred and your
      daughter Fanny. So do I. Do you believe that Alfred ran away with Fanny,
      or Fanny with Alfred. Theoretically, of course, the man does it. Do you
      believe Alfred did it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks&rsquo;s tone was resolute. Mrs. Newt was on the verge of
      hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insult my daughter to her mother&rsquo;s face?&rdquo;
      exclaimed she. &ldquo;O you mean to insinuate that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to insinuate nothing, my dear Mrs. Newt. I say plainly what
      I mean to say, so let us keep as cool as we can for the sake of all
      parties. They are married&mdash;that&rsquo;s settled. How are they going
      to live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt opened her mouth with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe the husband usually supports the wife,&rdquo; ejaculated
      the dragon behind the glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you to say, then, my dear Mrs. Newt,&rdquo; continued
      Mrs. Dinks, with a superb disregard of the older lady, who had made the
      remark, &ldquo;that the husband usually supports the family. Now in this
      matter, you know, we are going to be perfectly cool and sensible. You know
      as well as I that Alfred has no profession, but that be will by-and-by
      inherit a fortune from his grand-uncle&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Mrs. Dagon coughed in an incredulous and contemptuous
      manner. Mrs. Dinks put her handkerchief to her nose, which she patted
      gently, and waited for Mrs. Dagon to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying&mdash;a fortune from his grand-uncle. Now until
      then provision must be made&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dagon, for Mrs. Newt was bewildered into
      silence by the rapid conversation of Mrs. Dinks&mdash;&ldquo;really, these
      are matters of business which, I believe, are usually left to gentlemen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, of course, Mrs. Newt,&rdquo; continued the intrepid Mrs.
      Dinks, utterly regardless of Mrs. Dagon, for she had fully considered her
      part, and knew her own intentions, &ldquo;that such things are generally
      arranged by the gentlemen. But I think sensible women like you and I,
      mothers, too, are quite as much interested in the matter as fathers can
      be. Our honor is as much involved in the happiness of our children as
      their fathers&rsquo; is. So I have come to ask you, in a purely friendly
      and private manner, what the chances for our dear children are?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I know nothing,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Newt; &ldquo;I only
      know that Mr. Newt is furious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly lunatic,&rdquo; added Aunt Dagon, in full view of Mrs.
      Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity, pity!&rdquo; returned Mrs. Dinks, with an air of
      compassionate unconcern; &ldquo;because these things can always be so
      easily settled. I hope Mr. Newt won&rsquo;t suffer himself to be
      disturbed. Every thing will come right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Mr. Dinks say?&rdquo; feebly inquired Mrs. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dinks, with a cool
      air of surprise that any body should care what he thought&mdash;which made
      Mrs. Dagon almost envious of her enemy, and which so impressed Mrs. Newt,
      who considered the opinion of her husband as the only point of importance
      in the whole affair, that she turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that his mind is so engrossed with other matters that he
      rarely attends to the domestic details,&rdquo; added Mrs. Dinks, who had
      no desire of frightening any of her new relatives. &ldquo;Have you been to
      see Fanny yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Newt, half-sobbing again, &ldquo;I have
      only just heard of it; and&mdash;and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Newt
      would wish me to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks raised her eyebrows, and again touched her face gently with the
      handkerchief. Mrs. Dagon rubbed her glasses and waited, for she knew very
      well that Mrs. Dinks had not yet discovered what she had come to learn.
      The old General was not deceived by the light skirmishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry not to have seen Mr. Newt before he went down town,&rdquo;
      began Mrs. Dinks, after a pause. &ldquo;But since we must all know these
      matters sooner or later&mdash;that is to say, those of us whose business
      it is&rdquo;&mdash;here she glanced at Mrs. Dagon&mdash;&ldquo;you and I,
      my dear Mrs. Newt, may talk confidentially. How much will your husband
      probably allow Fanny until Alfred comes into his property?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks leaned back and folded her shawl closely around her, and Mrs.
      Dagon hemmed and smiled a smile of perfect incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious, gracious! Mrs. Dinks, Mr. Newt won&rsquo;t give her a
      cent!&rdquo; answered Mrs. Newt. As she uttered the words Mrs. Dagon held
      the enemy in full survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks was confounded. That there would be some trouble in arranging
      the matter she had expected. But the extreme dolefulness of Mrs. Newt had
      already perplexed her; and the prompt, simple way in which she answered
      this question precluded the suspicion of artifice. Something was clearly,
      radically wrong. She knew that Alfred had six hundred a year from his
      father. She had no profound respect for that gentleman; but men are
      willful. Suppose he should take a whim to stop it? On the other side, she
      knew that Boniface Newt was an obstinate man, and that fathers were
      sometimes implacable. Sometimes, even, they did not relent in making their
      wills. She knew all about Miss Van Boozenberg&rsquo;s marriage with Tom
      Witchet, for it was no secret in society. Was it possible her darling
      Alfred might be in actual danger of such penury&mdash;at least until he
      came into his property? And what property was it, and what were the
      chances that old Burt would leave him a cent?
    </p>
    <p>
      These considerations instantly occupied her mind as Mrs. Newt spoke; and
      she saw more clearly than ever the necessity of propitiating old Burt.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she asked, with an undismayed countenance, and with even a show
      of smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mrs. Newt, why do you take so cheerless a view of your husband&rsquo;s
      intentions in this matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words that her husband had spoken in his wrath had rung in Mrs. Newt&rsquo;s
      mind ever since, and they now fell, echo-like, from her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he said that, daughter or no daughter, she shall lie in the
      bed she has made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks could not help showing a little chagrin. It was the sign for
      Mrs. Newt to burst into fresh sorrow. Mrs. Dagon was as rigid as a bronze
      statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, Mrs. Newt,&rdquo; said her visitor, rising,
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt will have the satisfaction of seeing his daughter starve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, her husband will take care of that,&rdquo; said the bronze
      statue, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son Alfred,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Dinks, &ldquo;has an allowance
      of six hundred dollars a year, no profession, and expectations from his
      grand-uncle. These are his resources. If his father chooses, he can cut
      off his allowance. Perhaps he will. You can mention these facts to Mr.
      Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mercy! mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Newt. &ldquo;What shall we
      do? What will people say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, ladies!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dinks, with a comprehensive
      bow. She was troubled, but not overwhelmed; for she believed that the rich
      Mr. Newt would not, of course, allow his daughter to suffer. Mrs. Dagon
      was more profoundly persuaded than ever that Mrs. Dinks had managed the
      whole matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; said she, as the door closed upon Mrs. Dinks, &ldquo;it
      is a scheming, artful woman. Her son has no money, and I doubt if he ever
      will have any. Boniface will be implacable. I know him. He is capable of
      seeing his daughter suffer. Fanny has made a frightful mistake. Poor
      Fanny! she was not so clever as she thought herself. There is only one
      hope&mdash;that is in old Burt. I think we had better present that view
      chiefly to Boniface. We must concede the poverty, but insist and enlarge
      upon the prospect. No Newt ought to be allowed to suffer if we can help
      it. Poor Fanny! She was always pert, but not quite so smart as she thought
      herself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon indulged in a low chuckle of triumph, while Mrs. Newt was
      overwhelmed with a vague apprehension that all her husband&rsquo;s wrath
      at his daughter&rsquo;s marriage would be visited upon her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. &mdash; AT THE ROUND TABLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks had informed Hope that she was going home. That lady was
      satisfied, by her conversation with Mrs. Newt, that it would be useless
      for her to see Mr. Newt&mdash;that it was one of the cases in which facts
      and events plead much more persuasively than words. She was sure the rich
      merchant would not allow his daughter to suffer. Fathers do so in novels,
      thought she. Of course they do, for it is necessary to the interest of the
      story. And old Van Boozenberg does in life, thought she. Of course he
      does. But he is an illiterate, vulgar, hard old brute. Mr. Newt is of
      another kind. She had herself read his name as director of at least seven
      different associations for doing good to men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Dinks still delayed her departure. She knew that there was no
      reason for her staying, but she staid. She loved her son dearly. She was
      unwilling to leave him while his future was so dismally uncertain; and
      every week she informed Hope that she was on the point of going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne was not sorry to remain. Perhaps she also had her purposes. At
      Saratoga, in the previous summer, Arthur Merlin had remarked her incessant
      restlessness, and had connected it with the picture and the likeness of
      somebody. But when afterward, in New York, he cleared up the mystery and
      resolved who the somebody was, to his great surprise he observed, at the
      same time, that the restlessness of Hope Wayne was gone. From the months
      of seclusion which she had imposed upon herself he saw that she emerged
      older, calmer, and lovelier than he had ever seen her. The calmness was,
      indeed, a little unnatural. To his sensitive eye&mdash;for, as he said to
      Lawrence Newt, in explanation of his close observation, it is wonderful
      how sensitive an exclusive devotion to art will make the eye&mdash;to his
      eye the calmness was still too calm, as the gayety had been too gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the solitude of his studio, as he drew many pictures upon the canvas,
      and sang, and smoked, and scuffled across the floor to survey his work
      from a little distance&mdash;and studied its progress through his open
      fist&mdash;or as he lay sprawling upon his lounge in a cotton velvet
      Italian coat, inimitably befogged and bebuttoned&mdash;and puffed
      profusely, following the intervolving smoke with his eye&mdash;his
      meditations were always the same. He was always thinking of Hope Wayne,
      and befooling himself with the mask of art, actually hiding himself from
      himself: and not perceiving that when a man&rsquo;s sole thought by day
      and night is a certain woman, and an endless speculation about the quality
      of her feeling for another man, he is simply a lover thinking of his
      mistress and a rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infatuated painter suddenly became a great favorite in society. He
      could not tell why. Indeed there was no other secret than that he was a
      very pleasant young gentleman who made himself agreeable to young women,
      because he wished to know them and to paint them&mdash;not, as he wickedly
      told Lawrence Newt, who winked and did not believe a word of it, because
      the human being is the noblest subject of art&mdash;but only because he
      wished to show himself by actual experience how much more charming in
      character, and sprightly in intelligence, and beautiful in person and
      manner, Hope Wayne was than all other young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proved that important point to his perfect satisfaction. He punctually
      attended every meeting of the Round Table, as Lawrence called the meetings
      at which he and Arthur read and talked with Hope Wayne and Amy Waring,
      that he might lose no opportunity of pursuing the study. He found Hope
      Wayne always friendly and generous. She frankly owned that he had shown
      her many charming things in poetry that she had not known, and had helped
      her to form juster opinions. It was natural she should think it was Arthur
      who had helped her. She did not know that it was a very different person
      who had done the work&mdash;a person whose name was Abel Newt. For it was
      her changing character&mdash;changing in consequence of her acquaintance
      with Abel&mdash;which modified her opinions; and Arthur arrived upon her
      horizon at the moment of the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was always friendly and generous with him. But somehow he could not
      divest himself of the idea that she must be the Diana of his great
      picture. There was an indescribable coolness and remoteness about her. Has
      it any thing to do with that confounded sketch at Saratoga, and that&mdash;equally
      confounded Abel Newt? thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the conversation at the Round Table sometimes fell upon Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is certainly a handsome fellow,&rdquo; said Amy Waring. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t wonder at his success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beauty that does it, then, Miss Waring?&rdquo; asked
      Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does what?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that gives what you call social success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I mean that I don&rsquo;t wonder such a handsome, bright,
      graceful; accomplished young man, who lives in fine style, drives pretty
      horses, and knows every body, should be a great favorite with the girls
      and their mothers. Don&rsquo;t you see, Abel Newt is a sort of Alcibiades?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Pelham?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for he has sense enough to conceal the coxcomb. But you ought
      to know your own nephew, Mr. Newt,&rdquo; answered Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps; but I have a very slight acquaintance with him,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly like him,&rdquo; said Arthur Merlin, with
      perfect candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you knew him,&rdquo; replied Amy, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur blushed, for he did not personally know him; but he felt as if he
      did, so that he unwittingly spoke so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, hastily; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him, I
      believe; but I know about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this he looked at Hope Wayne, who had been sitting, working, in
      perfect silence. At the same moment she raised her eyes to his
      inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Arthur, quite confused, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t&mdash;somehow&mdash;that
      is to say, you know, there&rsquo;s a sort of impression you get about
      people&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt interposed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that Arthur doesn&rsquo;t like Abel for the same reason
      that oil doesn&rsquo;t like water; for the same reason that you, Miss Amy,
      and Miss Wayne, would probably not like such a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin looked fixedly at Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of man is Mr. Newt?&rdquo; asked Hope, faintly coloring.
      She was trying herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know him?&rdquo; asked Arthur, abruptly and keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hope, as she worked on, only a little more
      rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what kind of man do you think him to be?&rdquo; continued
      Arthur, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the question,&rdquo; answered Hope, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt and Amy Waring looked on during this little conversation.
      They both wanted Hope to like Arthur. They both doubted how Abel might
      have impressed her. Lawrence Newt had not carelessly said that neither Amy
      nor Hope would probably like Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hope is right, Arthur,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She asks what
      kind of man my nephew is. He is a brilliant man&mdash;a fascinating man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was Colonel Burr,&rdquo; said Hope Wayne, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, Miss Hope. You have mentioned the reason why neither you
      nor Amy would like my nephew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope and Amy understood. Arthur Merlin was bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am such a
      great fool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that poor little Grace Plumer,&rdquo; Lawrence Newt
      gravely said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be troubled about little Grace Plumer. She can take
      proper care of herself,&rdquo; answered Arthur, merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne&rsquo;s busy fingers did not stop. She remembered Miss Grace
      Plumer, and she did not agree with Arthur Merlin. Hope did not know Grace;
      but she knew the voice, the manner, the magnetism to which the gay girl
      was exposed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Godefroi Plumer is really as rich as I hear,&rdquo; said
      Lawrence, &ldquo;I think we shall have a Mrs. Abel Newt in the autumn.
      Poor Mrs. Abel Newt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head with that look, mingled of feeling and irony, which was
      very perplexing. The tone in which he spoke was really so full of
      tenderness for the girl, that Hope, who heard every word and felt every
      tone, was sure that Lawrence Newt pitied the prospective bride sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, Mr. Newt, and Miss Wayne,&rdquo; said Arthur Merlin;
      &ldquo;but how can a man have a high respect for women when he sees his
      sister do what Fanny Newt has done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should a man complain that his sister does precisely what he is
      trying to do himself?&rdquo; asked Lawrence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. &mdash; A LITTLE DINNER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Dinks told her husband of Alfred&rsquo;s marriage, the Honorable
      Budlong said it was a great pity, but that it all came of the foolish
      fondness of the boy&rsquo;s mother; that nothing was more absurd than for
      mothers to be eternally coddling their children. Although who would have
      attended to Mr. Alfred if his mother had not, the unemployed statesman
      forgot to state, notwithstanding that he had just written a letter upon
      public affairs, in which he eloquently remarked that he had no aspirations
      for public life; but that, afar from the turmoils of political strife, his
      modest ambition was satisfied in the performance of the sweet duties which
      the wise Creator, who has set the children of men in families, has imposed
      upon all parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Mr. Newt is a wealthy merchant. It&rsquo;s
      all right, my dear! Women, and especially mothers, are peculiarly silly at
      such times. Endeavor, Mrs. Dinks, to keep the absurdity&mdash;which, of
      course, you will not be able to suppress altogether&mdash;within bounds.
      Try to control your nerves, and rely upon Providence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith the statesman stroked his wife&rsquo;s chin. He controlled his
      own nerves perfectly, and went to dress for dinner with a select party at
      General Belch&rsquo;s, in honor of the Honorable B. J. Ele, who, in his
      capacity as representative in Washington, had ground an axe for his friend
      the General. Therefore, when the cloth was removed, the General rose and
      said: &ldquo;I know that we are only a party of friends, but I can not
      help indulging my feelings, and gratifying yours, by proposing the health
      of our distinguished, able, and high-minded representative, whose
      Congressional career proves that there is no office in the gift of a free
      and happy people to which he may not legitimately aspire. I have the honor
      and pleasure to propose, with three times three, the Honorable B. Jawley
      Ele.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Budlong Dinks led off in gravely pounding the table with his
      fork; and when the rattle of knives, and forks, and spoons, and glasses
      had subsided, and when Major Scuppernong, of North Carolina&mdash;who had
      dined very freely, and was not strictly following the order of events, but
      cried out in a loud voice in the midst of the applause, &ldquo;Encore,
      encore! good for Belch!&rdquo;&mdash;had been reduced to silence, then the
      honorable gentleman who had been toasted rose, and expressed his opinion
      of the state of the country, to the general effect that General Jackson&mdash;Sir,
      and fellow-citizens&mdash;I mean my friends, and you, Mr. Speaker&mdash;I
      beg pardon, General Belch, that General Jackson, gentlemen and ladies,
      that is to say, the relatives here present&mdash;I mean&mdash;yes&mdash;is
      one of the very greatest&mdash;I venture to say, and thrust it in the
      teeth and down the throat of calumny&mdash;<i>the</i> greatest human being
      that now lives, or ever did live, or ever can live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele sat down amidst a fury of applause. Major Scuppernong, of North
      Carolina, and Captain Lamb, of Pennsylvania, turned simultaneously to the
      young gentleman who sat between them, and who had been introduced to them
      by General Belch as Mr. Newt, son of our old Tammany friend Boniface Newt,
      and said to him, with hysterical fervor,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By G&mdash;, Sir! that is one of the greatest men in this country.
      He does honor, Sir, to the American name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen, without waiting for a reply, each seized a decanter and
      filled their glasses. Abel smiled and bowed on each side of him, filled
      his own glass and lighted a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, after General Belch had spoken and Mr. Ele had responded, it
      was necessary that every body else should be brought to a speech. General
      Belch mentioned the key-stone of the arch of States; and Captain Lamb, in
      reply, enlarged upon the swarthy sons of Pennsylvania. General Smith, of
      Vermont, when green mountains were gracefully alluded to by General Belch,
      was proud to say that he came&mdash;or, rather, he might say&mdash;yes, he
      <i>would</i> say, <i>hailed</i> from the hills of Ethan Allen; and, in
      closing, treated the company to the tale of Ticonderoga. The glittering
      mouth of the Father of Waters was a beautiful metaphor which brought
      Colonol le Fay, of Louisiana, to his feet; and the Colonel said that
      really he did not know what to say. &ldquo;Say that the Mississippi has
      more water in its mouth than ever you had!&rdquo; roared Major
      Scuppernong, with great hilarity. The company laughed, and the Colonel sat
      down. When General Belch mentioned Plymouth Hock, the Honorable Budlong
      Dinks sprang upon it, and congratulated himself and the festive circle he
      saw around him upon the inestimable boon of religious liberty which, he
      might say, was planted upon the rock of Plymouth, and blazed until it had
      marched all over the land, dispensing from its vivifying wings the healing
      dew of charity, like the briny tears that lave its base.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! beautiful! My God, Sir, what a poetic idea!&rdquo;
      murmured, or rather gurgled, Major Scuppernong to Abel at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when General Belch rose and said that eloquence was unnecessary when
      he mentioned one name, and that he therefore merely requested his friends
      to fill and pledge, without further introduction, &ldquo;The old North
      State,&rdquo; there was a prolonged burst of enthusiasm, during which
      Major Scuppernong tottered on to his feet and wavered there, blubbering in
      maudlin woe, and wiping his eyes with a napkin; while the company, who
      perceived his condition, rattled the table, and shouted, and laughed,
      until Sligo Moultrie, who sat opposite Abel, declared to him across the
      table that it was an abominable shame, that the whole South was insulted,
      and that he should say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee, Moultrie,&rdquo; said Abel to him, laughing; &ldquo;the
      South is no more insulted because Major Scuppernong, of North Carolina,
      gets drunk and makes a fool of himself than the North is insulted because
      General Smith, of Vermont, and the Honorable Dinks, of Boston, make fools
      of themselves without getting drunk. Do you suppose that, at this time of
      night, any of these people have the remotest idea of the points of the
      compass? Their sole interest at the present moment is to know whether the
      gallant Major will tumble under the table before he gets through his
      speech.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gallant Major did not get through his speech at all, because he
      never began it. The longer he stood the unsteadier he grew, and the more
      profusely he wept. Once or twice he made a motion, as if straightening
      himself to begin. The noise at table then subsided a little. The guests
      cried &ldquo;H&rsquo;st.&rdquo; There was a moment of silence, during
      which the eloquent and gallant Major mopped the lingering tears with his
      napkin, then his mouth opened in a maudlin smile; the roar began again,
      until at last the smile changed into a burst of sobbing, and to Abel Newt&rsquo;s
      extreme discomfiture, and Sligo Moultrie&rsquo;s secret amusement, Major
      Scuppernong suddenly turned and fell upon Abel&rsquo;s neck, and tenderly
      embraced him, whispering with tipsy tenderness, &ldquo;My dearest Belch, I
      love you! Yes, by Heaven! I swear I love you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel called the waiters, and had the gallant and eloquent Major removed to
      a sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He enjoys life, the Major, Sir,&rdquo; said Captain Lamb, of
      Pennsylvania, at Abel&rsquo;s left hand; &ldquo;a generous, large-hearted
      man. So is our host, Sir. General Belch is a man who knows enough to go in
      when it rains.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lamb, of Pennsylvania, cocked one eye at his glass, and then
      opening his mouth, and throwing his head a little back, tipped the entire
      contents down at one swallow. He filled the glass again, took a puff at
      his cigar, scratched his head a moment with the handle of a spoon, then
      opening his pocket-knife, proceeded to excavate some recesses in his teeth
      with the blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Dinks a rising man in Massachusetts, do you know, Sir?&rdquo;
      asked Captain Lamb of Abel, while the knife waited and rested a moment on
      the outside of the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he is, Sir,&rdquo; said Abel, at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there some talk of his going on a foreign mission?
      Seems to me I heard something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; replied Abel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a good deal
      about it. But I am not sure that he has received his commission yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lamb cocked his eye at Abel as if he had been a glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel rose, and, seating himself by Sligo Moultrie, entered into
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his object in moving was not talk. It was to give the cue to the
      company of changing their places, so that he might sit where he would. He
      drifted and tacked about the table for some time, and finally sailed into
      the port toward which he had been steering&mdash;an empty chair by Mr.
      Dinks. They said, good-evening. Mr. Dinks added, with a patronizing air,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you are not often at dinners of this kind, Mr. Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Abel; &ldquo;I usually dine on veal and spring
      chickens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Dinks, who thought Abel meant that he generally
      ate that food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that men of my years usually feed with younger and softer
      people than I see around me here,&rdquo; explained the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, I understand,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dinks, loftily,
      who had not the least idea what Abel meant; &ldquo;young men must expect
      to begin at women&rsquo;s dinners.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must, indeed,&rdquo; replied Abel. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Dinks, one
      of the pleasantest I remember was this last winter, under the auspices of
      your wife. Let me see, there were Mr. Moultrie there, Mr. Whitloe and Miss
      Magot, Mr. Bowdoin Beacon and Miss Amy Waring&mdash;and who else? Oh! I
      beg pardon, your son Alfred and my sister Fanny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the young gentleman filled a glass of wine, and looked over
      the rim at Mr. Dinks as he drained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the Honorable Mr. Dinks, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      go to women&rsquo;s dinners.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed entirely unconscious that he was conversing with the brother of
      the young lady with whom his son had eloped. Abel smiled to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we ought to congratulate each
      other, Mr. Dinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The honorable gentleman looked at Abel, paused a moment, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son marries at his own risk. Sir. He is of years of discretion,
      I believe, and having an income of only six hundred dollars a year, which
      I allow him, I presume he would not marry without some security upon the
      other side. However, Sir, as that is his affair, and as I do not find it
      very interesting&mdash;no offense, Sir, for I shall always be happy to see
      my daughter-in-law&mdash;we had better, perhaps, find some other topic.
      The art of life, my young friend, is to avoid what is disagreeable. Don&rsquo;t
      you think Mr. Ele quite a remarkable man? I regard him as an honor to your
      State, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very great honor, Sir, and all the gentlemen at this charming
      dinner are honors to the States from which they come, and to our common
      country, Mr. Dinks. We younger men are content to dine upon veal and
      spring chickens so long as we know that such intellects have the guidance
      of public affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abel Newt bowed to Mr. Dinks as he spoke, while that gentleman
      listened with the stately gravity with which a President of the United
      States hears the Latin oration in which he is made a Doctor of Laws. He
      bowed in reply to the little speech of Abel&rsquo;s, as if he desired to
      return thanks for the combined intellects that had been complimented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Sir,&rdquo; continued Abel, &ldquo;if my father should
      unhappily conceive a prejudice in regard to this elopement, and decline to
      know any thing of the happy pair, six hundred dollars, in the present
      liberal style of life incumbent upon a man who has moved in the circles to
      which your son has been accustomed, would be a very limited income for
      your son and daughter-in-law&mdash;very limited.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel lighted another cigar. Mr. Dinks was a little confounded by the
      sudden lurch of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, very,&rdquo; he replied, as if he were entirely loth to
      linger upon the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The father of the lady in these cases is very apt to be obdurate,&rdquo;
      said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think very likely,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dinks, with the polite air
      of a man assenting to an axiom in a science of which, unfortunately, he
      has not the slightest knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Sir,&rdquo; persisted Abel, &ldquo;I will not conceal from you&mdash;for
      I know a father&rsquo;s heart will wish to know to what his son is exposed&mdash;that
      my father is in quite a frenzy about this affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;ll get over it,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Dinks,
      complacently. &ldquo;They always do; and now, don&rsquo;t you think that
      we had better&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; struck in the other. &ldquo;But I, who know my
      father well, know that he will not relent. Oh, Sir, it is dreadful to
      think of a family divided!&rdquo; Abel puffed for a moment in silence.
      &ldquo;But I think my dearest father loves me enough to allow me to mould
      him a little. If, for instance, I could say to him that Mr. Dinks would
      contribute say fifteen hundred dollars a year, until Mr. Alfred comes into
      his fortune, I think in that case I might persuade him to advance as much;
      and so, Sir, your son and my dear sister might live somewhat as they have
      been accustomed, and their mutual affection would sustain them, I doubt
      not, until the grandfather died. Then all would be right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel blew his nose as if to command his emotion, and looked at Mr. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt, I should prefer to drop the subject. I can not afford to
      give my son a larger allowance. I doubt if he ever gets a cent from Mr.
      Burt, who is not his grandfather, but only the uncle of my wife. Possibly
      Mrs. Dinks may receive something. I repeat that I presume my son
      understands what he is about. If he has done a foolish thing, I am sorry.
      I hope he has not. Let us drink to the prosperity of the romantic young
      pair, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was satisfied. He had come to the dinner that he might discover, in the
      freedom of soul which follows a feast, what Alfred Dinks&rsquo;s prospects
      really were, and what his father would do for him. Boniface Newt, upon
      coming to the store after the <i>tête-à-tête</i> with his wife, had told
      Abel of his sister&rsquo;s marriage. Abel had comforted his parent by the
      representation of the probable Burt inheritance. But the father was
      skeptical. Therefore, when General Arcularius Belch requested the pleasure
      of Mr. Abel Newt&rsquo;s company at dinner, to meet the Honorable B.
      Jawley Ele&mdash;an invitation which was dictated by General Belch&rsquo;s
      desire to stand well with Boniface Newt, who contributed generously to the
      expenses of the party&mdash;the father and son both perceived the
      opportunity of discovering what they wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Dinks will have six hundred a year, as long as
      papa Dinks chooses to pay it,&rdquo; said Abel to his father the day after
      the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt clenched his teeth and struck his fist upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a cent shall they have from me!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;What
      the devil does a girl mean, by this kind of thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel was not discomposed. He did not clench his teeth or strike his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what they can do, father,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father looked at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can take Mr. and Mrs. Tom Witchet to board.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt remembered every thing he had said of Mr. Van Boozenberg. But of
      late, his hair was growing very gray, his brow very wrinkled, his
      expression very anxious and weary. When he remembered the old banker, it
      was with no self-reproach that he himself was now doing what, in the
      banker&rsquo;s case, he had held up to Abel&rsquo;s scorn. It was only to
      remember that the wary old man had shut down the portcullis of the bank
      vaults, and that loans were getting to be almost impossible. His face
      darkened. He swore a sharp oath. &ldquo;That&mdash;old villain!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. &mdash; CLEARING AND CLOUDY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was summer again, and Aunt Martha sat sewing in the hardest of wooden
      chairs, erect, motionless. Yet all the bleakness of the room was conquered
      by the victorious bloom of Amy&rsquo;s cheeks, and the tender maidenliness
      of Amy&rsquo;s manner, and the winning, human, sympathetic sweetness which
      was revealed in every word and look of Amy, who sat beside her aunt,
      talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy, Lawrence Newt has been here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman looked almost troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Amy, I know you did not tell him,&rdquo; said Aunt Martha.
      &ldquo;I was all alone here, as usual, and heard a knock. I cried, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s
      there?&rsquo; for I was afraid to open the door, lest I should see some
      old friend. &lsquo;A friend,&rsquo; was the reply. My knees trembled, Amy.
      I thought the time had come for me to be exposed to the world, that the
      divine wrath might be fulfilled in my perfect shame. I had no right to
      resist, and said, 'Come in!&rsquo; The door opened, and a man entered whom
      I did not at first recognize. He looked at me for a moment kindly&mdash;so
      kindly, that it seemed to me as if a gentle hand were laid upon my head.
      Then he said, &lsquo;Martha Darro.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am ready,&rsquo; I
      answered. But he came to me and took my hand, and said, &lsquo;Why,
      Martha, have you forgotten Lawrence Newt?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped in her story, and leaned back in her chair. The work fell from
      her thin fingers, and she wept&mdash;soft tears, like a spring rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Amy, after a few moments, and her hand had taken
      Aunt Martha&rsquo;s, but she let it go again when she saw that it helped
      her to tell the story if she worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he had seen you at the window one day, and he was resolved
      to find out what brought you into Front Street. But before he could make
      up his mind to come, he chanced to see me at the same window, and then he
      waited no longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was more natural than Amy had ever heard from Aunt Martha&rsquo;s
      lips. She remarked that the severity of her costume was unchanged, except
      that a little strip of white collar around the throat somewhat alleviated
      its dense gloom. Was it Amy&rsquo;s fancy merely that the little line of
      white was symbolical, and that she saw a more human light in her aunt&rsquo;s
      eyes and upon her face?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Amy again, after another pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn woman did not immediately answer, but went on sewing, and
      rocking her body as she did so. Amy waited patiently until her aunt should
      choose to answer. She waited the more patiently because she was telling
      herself who it was that had brought that softer light into the face, if,
      indeed, it were really there. She was thinking why he had been curious to
      know the reason that she had come into that room. She was remembering a
      hundred little incidents which had revealed his constant interest in all
      her comings, and goings, and doings; and therefore she started when Aunt
      Martha, still rocking and sewing, said, quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did Lawrence Newt care what brought you here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, Aunt Martha.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Amy looked as indifferent as she could, knowing that her companion
      was studying her face. And it was a study that companion relentlessly
      pursued, until Amy remarked that Lawrence Newt was such a generous
      gentleman that he could get wind of no distress but he instantly looked to
      see if he could relieve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the theme fertile, Amy Waring, looking, with tender eyes at her
      relative, continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet with all the freedom with which she told the story of Lawrence
      Newt&rsquo;s large heart, there was an unusual softness and shyness in her
      appearance. The blithe glance was more drooping. The clear, ringing voice
      was lower. The words that generally fell with such a neat, crisp
      articulation from her lips now lingered upon them as if they were somehow
      honeyed, and so flowed more smoothly and more slowly. She told of her
      first encounter with Mr. Newt at the Widow Simmers&rsquo;s&mdash;she told
      of all that she had heard from her cousin, Gabriel Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Aunt Martha, I should like to have every body think of me
      as kindly as he thinks of every body.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been speaking for some time. When she stopped, Aunt Martha said,
      quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Amy, although you have told me how charitable he is, you have
      not told me why he wanted to come here because he saw you at the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; replied Amy, &ldquo;it was because he thought
      there must be somebody to relieve here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose he thinks there is somebody to relieve in
      the next house, and the next, and has been ever since he has had an office
      in South Street?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy felt very warm, and replied, carelessly, that she thought it was quite
      likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have plenty of time to think up here, my child,&rdquo; continued
      Aunt Martha. &ldquo;God is so good that He has spared my reason, and I
      have satisfied myself why Lawrence Newt wanted to come here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy sat without replying, as if she were listening to distant music. Her
      head drooped slightly forward; her hands were clasped in her lap; the
      delicate color glimmered upon her cheek, now deepening, now paling. The
      silence was exquisite, but she must break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said she, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he loves you, Amy,&rdquo; said the dark woman, as her busy
      fingers stitched without pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring was perfectly calm. The words seemed to give her soul delicious
      peace, and she waited to hear what her aunt would say next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that he loves you, from the way in which he spoke of you. I
      know that you love him for the same reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha went on working and rocking. Amy turned pale. She had not
      dared to say to herself what another had now said to her. But suddenly she
      started as if stung. &ldquo;If Aunt Martha has seen this so plainly, why
      may not Lawrence Newt have seen it?&rdquo; The apprehension frightened
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed the last words of Aunt Martha. She did not look at
      Amy, for she had no external curiosity to satisfy, and she understood well
      enough what Amy was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were still silent, when there was a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the clear, hard voice of Aunt Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened&mdash;the two women looked&mdash;and Lawrence Newt walked
      into the room. He shook hands with Aunt Martha, and then turned to Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time, Miss Amy, I have caught you. Have I not kept your secret
      well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy was thinking of another secret than Aunt Martha&rsquo;s living in
      Front Street, and she merely blushed, without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried very hard to persuade myself to come up here after I saw
      you at the window. But I did not until the secret looked out of the window
      and revealed itself. I came to-day to say that I am going out of town in a
      day or two, and that I should like, before I go, to know that I may do
      what I can to take Aunt Martha out of this place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha shook her head slowly. &ldquo;Why should it be?&rdquo; said
      she. &ldquo;Great sin must be greatly punished. To die, while I live; to
      be buried alive close to my nearest and dearest; to know that my sister
      thinks of me as dead, and is glad that I am so&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Aunt Martha, stop!&rdquo; cried Amy, with the same firm tone
      in which, upon a previous visit, in this room, she had dismissed the
      insolent shopman, &ldquo;how can you say such things?&rdquo; and she stood
      radiant before her aunt, while Lawrence Newt looked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy, dear, you can not understand. Sons and daughters of evil, when
      we see that we have sinned, we must be brave enough to assist in our own
      punishment. God&rsquo;s mercy enables me tranquilly to suffer the penalty
      which his justice awards me. My path is very plain. Please God, I shall
      walk in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it very slowly, and solemnly, and sadly. Whatever her offense
      was, she had invested her situation with the dignity of a religious duty.
      It was clear that her idea of obedience to God was to do precisely what
      she was doing. And this was so deeply impressed upon Amy Waring&rsquo;s
      mind that she was perplexed how to act. She knew that if her aunt
      suspected in her any intention of revealing the secret of her abode, she
      would disappear at once, and elude all search. And to betray it while it
      was unreservedly confided to her was impossible for Amy, even if she had
      not solemnly promised not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing that Amy meant to say nothing, Lawrence Newt turned to Aunt
      Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not quarrel with what you say, but I want you to grant me a
      request.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha bowed, as if waiting to see if she could grant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is not unreasonable, will you grant it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now please, I want you to go next Sunday and hear a man
      preach whom I am very fond of hearing, and who has been of the greatest
      service to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, do you ever go to church?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha did not directly reply. She was lost in reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a youth like an angel,&rdquo; said she at length, with an air
      of curious excitement, as if talking to herself. &ldquo;His voice is
      music, but it strikes my soul through and through, and I am frightened and
      in agony, as if I had been pierced with the flaming sword that waves over
      the gate of Paradise. The light of his words makes my sin blacker and more
      loathsome. Oh! what crowds there are! How he walks upon a sea of sinners,
      with their uplifted faces, like waves white with terror! How fierce his
      denunciation! How sweet the words of promise he speaks! &lsquo;The
      sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O
      God, thou wilt not despise.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen from her chair, and stood with her eyes lifted in a singular
      condition of mental exaltation, which gave a lyrical tone and flow to her
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Summerfield,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt. &ldquo;Yes, he is a
      wonderful youth. I have heard him myself, and thought that I saw the fire
      of Whitfield, and heard the sweetness of Charles Wesley. I have been into
      the old John Street meeting-house, where the crowds hung out at the
      windows and doors like swarming bees clustered upon a hive. He swayed them
      as a wind bends a grain-field, Miss Amy. He swept them away like a
      mountain stream. He is an Irishman, with all the fervor of Irish genius.
      But,&rdquo; continued Lawrence Newt, turning again to Aunt Martha, &ldquo;it
      is a very different man I want you to hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Channing. He comes from Boston.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he preach the truth?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he does,&rdquo; answered Lawrence, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he drive home the wrath of God upon the sinful, rebellious
      soul?&rdquo; exclaimed she, raising both hands with the energy of her
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He preaches the Gospel of Christ,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt,
      quietly; &ldquo;and I think you will like him, and that he will do you
      good. He is called&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what he is called,&rdquo; interrupted Aunt
      Martha, &ldquo;if he makes me feel my sin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will discover for yourself,&rdquo; replied Lawrence,
      smiling. &ldquo;He makes me feel mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha, whose ecstasy had passed, seated herself, and said she would
      go, as Mr. Newt requested, on the condition that neither he nor Amy, if
      they were there, would betray that they knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was readily promised, and Amy and Lawrence Newt left the room
      together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. &mdash; WALKING HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Amy,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, as they walked slowly toward
      Fulton Street, &ldquo;I hope that gradually we may overcome this morbid
      state of mind in your aunt, and restore her to her home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy said she hoped so too, and walked quietly by his side. There was
      something almost humble in her manner. Her secret was her own no longer.
      Was it Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s? Had she indeed betrayed herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say why I was going out of town. Yet I ought to tell
      you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you tell me?&rdquo; she answered, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it concerns our friend Hope Wayne,&rdquo; said Lawrence.
      &ldquo;See, here is the note which I received this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he opened it, and read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR MR. NEWT,&mdash;Mrs. Simcoe writes me that grandfather has
      had a stroke of paralysis, and lies very ill. Aunt Dinks has, therefore,
      resolved to leave on Monday, and I shall go with her. She seems very much
      affected, indeed, by the news. Mrs. Simcoe writes that the doctor says
      grandfather will hardly live more than a few days, and she wishes you
      could go on with us. I know that you have some kind of association with
      Pinewood&mdash;you have not told me what. In this summer weather you will
      find it very beautiful; and you know how glad I shall be to have you for
      my guest. My guest, I say; for while grandfather lies so dangerously ill I
      must be what my mother would have been&mdash;mistress of the house. I
      shall hardly feel more lonely than I always did when he was active, for we
      had but little intercourse. In case of his death, which I suppose to be
      very near, I shall not care to live at the old place. In fact, I do not
      very clearly see what I am to do. But there is One who does; and I
      remember my dear old nurse&rsquo;s hymn, &lsquo;On Thee I cast my care.&rsquo;
      Come, if you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;HOPE WAYNE.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt and Amy walked on for some time in silence. At length Amy
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just one of the cases in which it is a pity she is not
      married or engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that always a pity for a young woman?&rdquo; asked
      Lawrence, shooting entirely away from the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theoretically, yes,&rdquo; replied Amy, firmly, &ldquo;but not
      actually. It may be a pity that every woman is not married; but it might
      be a greater pity that she should marry any of the men who ask her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, dryly, &ldquo;if she didn&rsquo;t
      love him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and sometimes even if she did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring was conscious that her companion looked at her in surprise as
      she said this, but she fixed her eyes directly before her, and walked
      straight on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt; &ldquo;I see. You mean when he does
      not love her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean sometimes even when they do love each other,&rdquo; said
      the resolute Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was alarmed. &ldquo;Does she mean to convey to me delicately
      that there may be cases of true mutual love where it is better not to
      marry?&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Where, for instance, there is a
      difference of age perhaps, or where there has been some other and earlier
      attachment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Amy, as if answering his thoughts, &ldquo;that
      there may sometimes be reasons why even lovers should not marry&mdash;reasons
      which every noble man and woman understand; and therefore I do not agree
      with you that it is always a pity for a girl not to be married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt said nothing. Amy Waring&rsquo;s voice almost trembled with
      emotion, for she knew that her companion might easily misunderstand what
      she said; and yet there was no way to help it. At any rate, thought she,
      he will see that I do not mean to drop into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked silently on. The people in the street passed them like
      spectres. The great city hummed around them unheard. Lawrence Newt said to
      himself, half bitterly, &ldquo;So you have waked up at last, have you? You
      have found that because a beautiful young woman is kind to you, it does
      not follow that she will one day be your wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke. &ldquo;She sees,&rdquo; thought Lawrence Newt, &ldquo;that
      I love her, and she wishes to spare me the pain of hearing that it is in
      vain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he thought, with tenderness and longing toward the
      beautiful girl that walked beside him&mdash;&ldquo;at least, I was not
      mistaken. She was nobler and lovelier than I supposed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written to ask Hope Wayne to go and hear my preacher
      to-morrow. Miss Amy, will you go too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and bowed. Her eyes were glistening with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Miss Amy,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, impetuously,
      seizing her hand, as her face turned toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! please, Mr. Newt&mdash;please&mdash;&rdquo; she answered,
      hastily, in a tone of painful entreaty, withdrawing her hand from his
      grasp, confused and very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words died upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me&mdash;forgive me!&rdquo; he said, with an air of
      surprise and sadness, and with a voice trembling with tenderness and
      respect. &ldquo;She can not bear to give me the pain of plainly saying
      that she does not love me,&rdquo; thought Lawrence; and he gently took her
      hand and laid her arm in his, as if to show that now they understood each
      other perfectly, and all was well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, Miss Amy,&rdquo; he said, by-and-by, tranquilly, and with
      the old cheerfulness, &ldquo;at least we shall be friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring bent her head and was silent. It seemed to her that she was
      suffocating, for his words apprised her how strangely he had mistaken her
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said nothing more. Arm in arm they passed up Broadway. Every moment
      Amy Waring supposed the merchant would take leave of her and return to his
      office. But every moment he was farther from doing it. Abel Newt and Grace
      Plumer passed them, and opened their eyes; and Grace said to Abel,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has Amy Waring been engaged to your Uncle Lawrence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached Amy&rsquo;s door Lawrence Newt raised her hand, bent
      over it with quaint, courtly respect, held it a moment, then pressed it to
      his lips. He looked up at her. She was standing on the step; her full,
      dark eyes, swimming with moisture, were fixed upon his; her luxuriant hair
      curled over her clear, rich cheeks&mdash;youth, love, and beauty, they
      were all there. Lawrence Newt could hardly believe they were not all his.
      It was so natural to think so. Somehow he and Amy had grown together. He
      understood her perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Why you are holding
      her hand; you are kissing it with reverence; you are looking into the face
      which is dearer and lovelier to you than all other human faces; and you
      are as far off as if oceans rolled between.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. &mdash; CHURCH GOING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Sunday bells rang loud from river to river. Loud and sharp they rang
      in the clear, still air of the summer morning, as if the voice of
      Everardus Bogardus, the old Dominie of New Amsterdam, were calling the
      people in many tones to be up and stirring, and eat breakfast, and wash
      the breakfast things, and be in your places early, with bowed heads and
      reverend minds, and demurely hear me tell you what sinners you always have
      been and always will be, so help me God&mdash;I, Everardus Bogardus, in
      the clear summer morning, ding, dong, bell, amen!
    </p>
    <p>
      So mused Arthur Merlin, between sleeping and waking, as the bells rang
      out, loud and low&mdash;distant and near&mdash;flowing like a rushing,
      swelling tide of music along the dark inlets of narrow streets&mdash;touching
      arid hearts with hope, as the rising water touches dry spots with green.
      Come you, too, out of your filthy holes and hovels&mdash;come to church as
      in the days when you were young and had mothers, and you, grisly, drunken,
      blear-eyed thief, lisped in your little lessons&mdash;come, all of you,
      come! The day has dawned; the air is pure; the hammer rests&mdash;come and
      repent, and be renewed, and be young again. The old, weary, restless,
      debauched, defeated world&mdash;it shall sing and dance. You shall be
      lambs. I see the dawn of the millennium on the heights of Hoboken&mdash;yea,
      even out of the Jerseys shall a good thing come! It is I who tell you&mdash;it
      is I who order you&mdash;I, Everardus Bogardus, Dominie of New Amsterdam&mdash;ding,
      dong, bell, amen!
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were quiet and deserted. A single hack rattled under his
      window, and Arthur could hear its lessening sound until it was lost in the
      sweet clangor of the bells. He lay in bed, and did not see the people in
      the street; but he heard the shuffling and the slouching, the dragging
      step and the bright, quick footfall. There were gay bonnets and black hats
      already stirring&mdash;early worshippers at the mass at St. Peter&rsquo;s
      or St. Patrick&rsquo;s&mdash;but the great population of the city was at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except, among the rest, a young man who comes hastily out of Thiel&rsquo;s,
      over Stewart&rsquo;s&mdash;a young man of flowing black hair and fiery
      black eyes, which look restlessly and furtively up and down Broadway,
      which seems to the young man odiously and unnaturally bright. He gains the
      street with a bound. He hurries along, restless, disordered, excited&mdash;the
      black eyes glancing anxiously about, as if he were jealous of any that
      should see his yesterday was not over, and that somehow his wild, headlong
      night had been swept into the serene, open bay of morning. He hurries up
      the street; tossing many thoughts together&mdash;calculating his losses,
      for the black-haired young man has lost heavily at Thiel&rsquo;s
      faro-table&mdash;wondering about payments&mdash;remembering that it is
      Sunday morning, and that he is to attend a young lady from the South to
      church&mdash;a young lady whose father has millions, if universal
      understanding be at all correct&mdash;thinking of revenge at the table, of
      certain books full of figures in a certain counting-room, and the story
      they tell&mdash;story known to not half a dozen people in the world; the
      black-eyed youth, in evening dress, alert, graceful, but now meandering
      and gliding swiftly like a snake, darts up Broadway, and does not seem to
      hear the bells, whose first stroke startled him as he sat at play, and
      which are now ringing strange changes in the peaceful air: Come, Newt!
      Come, Newt! Abel Newt! Come, Newt! It is I, Everardus, Dominie Bogardus&mdash;come,
      come, come! and be d&mdash;&mdash;d, ding, dong, bell, amen-n-n-n!
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the morning the bells rang again. The house doors opened, and the
      sidewalk swarmed with well-dressed people. Boniface Newt and his wife
      sedately proceeded to church&mdash;not a new bonnet escaping Mrs. Nancy,
      while May walked tranquilly behind&mdash;like an angel going home, as
      Gabriel Bennet said in his heart when he passed her with his sister Ellen
      leaning on his arm. The Van Boozenberg carriage rolled along the street,
      conveying Mr. and Mrs. Jacob to meditate upon heavenly things. Mrs. Dagon
      and Mrs. Orry passed, and bowed sweetly, on their way to learn how to love
      their neighbors as themselves. And among the rest walked Lawrence Newt
      with Amy Waring, and Arthur Merlin with Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter had heard the voice of the Dominie Bogardus, which his fancy
      had heard in the air; or was he obeying another Dominie, of a wider
      parish, whose voice he heard in his heart? It was not often that the
      painter went to church. More frequently, in his little studio at the top
      of a house in Fulton Street, he sat smoking meditative cigars during the
      Sunday hours; or, if the day were auspicious, even touching his canvas!
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain his sober friends remonstrated. Aunt Winnifred, with whom he
      lived, was never weary of laboring with him. She laid good books upon the
      table in his chamber. He returned late at night, often, and found little
      tracts upon his bureau, upon the chair in which he usually laid his
      clothes when he retired&mdash;yes, even upon his pillow. &ldquo;Aunt
      Winnifred&rsquo;s piety leaves its tracts all over my room,&rdquo; he
      said, smilingly, to Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the good lady openly attacked him, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, how can you? What will people think? Why don&rsquo;t you go
      to church?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur replied, with entire coolness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Winnifred, what&rsquo;s the use of going to church when Van
      Boozenberg goes, and is not in the least discomposed? I&rsquo;m afraid of
      the morality of such a place!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Winnifred&rsquo;s eyes dilated with horror. She had no argument to
      throw at Arthur in return, and that reckless fellow always had to help her
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, dear aunt, you go; and I suppose you ought to be quite as
      good a reason for going as Van Boozenberg for staying away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After such a conversation it fairly rained tracts in Arthur&rsquo;s room.
      The shower was only the signal for fresh hostilities upon his part; but
      for all the hostility Aunt Winnifred was not able to believe her nephew to
      be a very bad young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he and his friends passed up Broadway toward Chambers Street they met
      Abel Newt hastening down to Bunker&rsquo;s to accompany Miss Plumer to
      Grace Church. The young man had bathed and entirely refreshed himself
      during the hour or two since he had stepped out of Thiel&rsquo;s. There
      was not a better-dressed man upon Broadway; and many a hospitable feminine
      eye opened to entertain him as long and as much as possible as he passed
      by. He had an unusual flush in his cheek and spring in his step. Perhaps
      he was excited by the novelty of mixing in a throng of church-goers. He
      had not done such a thing since on summer Sunday mornings he used to
      stroll with the other boys along the broad village road, skirted with
      straggling houses, to Dr. Peewee&rsquo;s. Heavens! in what year was that?
      he thought, unconsciously. Am I a hundred years old? On those mornings he
      used to see&mdash;Precisely the person he saw at the moment the thought
      crossed his mind&mdash;Hope Wayne&mdash;who bowed to him as he passed her
      party. How much calmer, statelier, and more softly superior she was than
      in those old Delafield days!
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered, too; and as the lithe, graceful figure of the handsome and
      fascinating Mr. Abel Newt bent in passing, Arthur Merlin, who felt, at the
      instant Abel passed, as if his own feet were very large, and his clothes
      ugly, and his movement stupidly awkward&mdash;felt, in fact, as if he
      looked like a booby&mdash;Arthur Merlin observed that his companion went
      on speaking, that she did not change color, and that her voice was neither
      hurried nor confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did the young painter, as he observed these little things, feel as if
      the sun shone with unusual splendor? Why did he think he had never heard a
      bird sing so sweetly as one that hung at an open window they passed? Nay,
      why in that moment was he almost willing to paint Abel Newt as the
      Endymion of his great picture?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. &mdash; IN CHURCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They turned into Chambers Street, in which was the little church where Dr.
      Channing was to preach. Lawrence Newt led the way up the aisle to his pew.
      The congregation, which was usually rather small, to-day quite filled the
      church. There was a general air of intelligence and shrewdness in the
      faces, which were chiefly of the New England type. Amy Waring saw no one
      she had ever seen before. In fact, there were but few present in whose
      veins New England blood did not run, except some curious hearers who had
      come from a natural desire to see and hear a celebrated man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our friends entered the church a slow, solemn voluntary was playing
      upon the organ. The congregation sat quietly in the pews. Chairs and
      benches were brought to accommodate the increasing throng. Presently the
      house was full. The bustle and distraction of entering were over&mdash;there
      was nothing heard but the organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments a slight man, wrapped in a black silk gown, slowly
      ascended the pulpit stairs, and, before seating himself, stood for a
      moment looking down at the congregation. His face was small, and thin, and
      pale; but there was a pure light, an earnest, spiritual sweetness in the
      eyes&mdash;the irradiation of an anxious soul&mdash;as they surveyed the
      people. After a few moments the music stopped. There was perfect silence
      in the crowded church. Then, moving like a shadow to the desk, the
      preacher, in a voice that was in singular harmony with the expression of
      his face, began to read a hymn. His voice had a remarkable cadence, rising
      and falling with yearning tenderness and sober pathos. It seemed to impart
      every feeling, every thought, every aspiration of the hymn. It was full of
      reverence, gratitude, longing, and resignation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;While Thee I seek, protecting Power,
  Be my vain wishes stilled;
And may this consecrated hour
  With better hopes be filled.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When he had read it and sat down again, Hope Wayne felt as if a religious
      service had already been performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplicity, and fervor, and long-drawn melody with which he had read
      the hymn apparently inspired the choir with sympathy, and after a few
      notes from the organ they began to sing an old familiar tune. It was taken
      up by the congregation until the church trembled with the sound, and the
      saunterers in the street outside involuntarily ceased laughing and
      talking, and, touched by some indefinable association, raised their hats
      and stood bareheaded in the sunlight, while the solemn music filled the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hymn was sung, the prayer was offered, the chapter was read; then,
      after a little silence, that calm, refined, anxious, pale, yearning face
      appeared again at the desk. The preacher balanced himself for a few
      moments alternately upon each foot&mdash;moved his tongue, as if tasting
      the words he was about to utter&mdash;and announced his text: &ldquo;Peace
      I leave with you: my peace I give unto you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He began in the same calm, simple way. A natural, manly candor certified
      the truth of every word he spoke. The voice&mdash;at first high in tone,
      and swinging, as it were, in long, wave-like inflections&mdash;grew
      gradually deeper, and more equally sustained. There was very little
      movement of the hands or arms; only now and then the finger was raised, or
      the hand gently spread and waved. As he warmed in his discourse a kind of
      celestial grace glimmered about his person, and his pale, thoughtful face
      kindled and beamed with holy light. His sentences were entirely simple.
      There was no rhetoric, no declamation or display. Yet the soul of the
      hearer seemed to be fused in a spiritual eloquence which, like a white
      flame, burned all the personality of the speaker away. The people sat as
      if they were listening to a disembodied soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the appeal and the argument were never to passion, or prejudice, or
      mere sensibility. Fear and horror, and every kind of physical emotion, so
      to say, were impossible in the calmness and sweetness of the assurance of
      the Divine presence. It was a Father whose message the preacher brought.
      Like as a father so the Lord pitieth His children, said he, in tones that
      trickled like tears over the hearts of his hearers, although his voice was
      equable and unbroken. He went on to show what the children of such a
      Father must needs be&mdash;to show that, however sinful, and erring, and
      lost, yet the Father had sent to tell them that the doctrine of wrath was
      of old time; that the eye for the eye, and the tooth for the tooth, was
      the teaching of an imperfect knowledge; that a faith which was truly
      childlike knew the Creator only as a parent; and that out of such faith
      alone arose the life that was worthy of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering princes are we! cried the preacher, with a profound ecstasy and
      exultation in his tone, while the very light of heaven shone in his aspect&mdash;wandering
      princes are we, sons of the Great King. In foreign lands outcast and
      forlorn, groveling with the very swine in the mire, and pining for the
      husks that the swine do eat; envying, defying, hating, forgetting&mdash;but
      never hated nor forgot; in the depths of our rage, and impotence, and sin&mdash;in
      the darkest moment of our moral death, when we would crucify the very
      image of that Parent who pities us&mdash;there is one voice deeper and
      sweeter than all music, the voice of our elder brother pleading with that
      common Father&mdash;&ldquo;Forgive them, forgive them, for they know not
      what they do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, but the congregation did not move. Leaning forward, with
      upraised eyes glistening with tears and beaming with sympathy, with hope,
      with quickened affection, they sat motionless, seemingly unwilling to
      destroy the holy calm in which, with him, they had communed with their
      Father. There were those in the further part of the church who did not
      hear; but their mouths were open with earnest attention; their eyes
      glittered with moisture; for they saw afar off that slight, rapt figure;
      and so strong was the common sympathy of the audience that they seemed to
      feel what they could not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt did not look round for Aunt Martha. But he thought of her
      listening to the discourse, as one thinks of dry fields in a saturating
      summer rain. She sat through the whole&mdash;black, immovable, silent. The
      people near her looked at her compassionately. They thought she was an
      inconsolable widow, or a Rachel refusing comfort. Nor, had they watched
      her, could they have told if she had heard any thing to comfort or relieve
      her sorrow. From the first word to the last she gazed fixedly at the
      speaker. With the rest she rose and went out. But as she passed by the
      pulpit stairs she looked up for a moment at that pallid face, and a finer
      eye than any human saw that she longed, like another woman of old looking
      at another teacher, to kiss the hem of his garment. Oh! not by earthquake
      nor by lightning, but by the soft touch of angels at midnight, is the
      stone rolled away from the door of the sepulchre.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. &mdash; IN ANOTHER CHURCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While thus one body of Christian believers worshipped, another was
      assembled in the Methodist chapel in John Street, where Aunt Martha
      usually went.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vast congregation crowded every part of the church. They swarmed upon
      the pulpit stairs, upon the gallery railings, and wherever a foot could
      press itself to stand, or room be found to sit. As the young preacher,
      Summerfield, rose in the pulpit, every eye in the throng turned to him and
      watched his slight, short figure&mdash;his sweet blue eye, and his face of
      earnest expression and a kind of fiery sweetness. He closed his eyes and
      lifted his hands in prayer; and the great responsibility of speaking to
      that multitude of human beings of their most momentous interests evidently
      so filled and possessed him, that in the prayer he seemed to yearn for
      strength and the gifts of grace so earnestly&mdash;he cried, so as if his
      heart were bursting, &ldquo;Help, Lord, or I perish!&rdquo; that the great
      congregation, murmuring with sobs, with gasps and sighs, echoed solemnly,
      as if it had but one voice, and it were muffled in tears, &ldquo;Help,
      Lord, or I perish!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prayer was ended a hymn was sung by all the people, to a quick,
      martial melody, and seemed to leave them nervously awake to whatever
      should be said. The preacher, with the sweet boyish face, began his sermon
      gently, and in a winning voice. There was a kind of caressing persuasion
      in his whole manner that magnetized the audience. He grew more and more
      impassioned as he advanced, while the people sat open-mouthed, and
      responding at intervals, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sinner, sinner, it is he, our God, who shoots us through and
      through with the sharp sweetness of his power. It is our God who scatters
      the arrows of his wrath; but they are winged with the plumes of the dove,
      the feathers of softness, and the Gospel. Oh! the promises! the promises!&mdash;Come
      unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
      Yes, patriarch of white hairs, of wasted cheeks, and tottering step! the
      burden bears you down almost to the ground to-day&mdash;into the ground
      to-morrow. Here stands the Judge to give you rest. Yes, mother of sad eyes
      and broken spirit! whose long life is a sorrowful vigil, waiting upon the
      coming of wicked sons, of deceitful daughters&mdash;weary, weary, and
      heavy laden with tribulation, here is the Comforter who shall give you
      rest. And you, young man, and you, young maiden, sitting here to-day in
      the plenitude of youth, and hope, and love, Remember your Creator in the
      days of your youth, for the dark day cometh&mdash;yea, it is at hand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So fearfully did his voice, and look, and manner express apprehension, as
      if something were about to fall upon the congregation, that there was a
      sudden startled cry of terror. There were cries of &ldquo;Lord! Lord! have
      mercy!&rdquo; Smothered shrieks and sobs filled the air; pale faces stared
      at each other like spectres. People fell upon their knees, and cried out
      that they felt the power of the Lord. &ldquo;My soul sinks in deep waters,
      Selah;&rdquo; cried the preacher, &ldquo;but they are the waters of grace
      and faith, and I am convicted of all my sins.&rdquo; Then pausing a
      moment, while the vast crowd swayed and shook with the tumult of emotion,
      with his arms outspread, the veins on his forehead swollen, and the light
      flashing in his eyes, he raised his arms and eyes to heaven, and said,
      with inexpressible sweetness, in tones which seemed to trickle with balm
      into the very soul, as soft spring rains ooze into the ground, &ldquo;Yea,
      it is at hand, but so art thou! Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly; and when
      youth, and hope, and love have become dead weights and burdens in these
      young hearts, teach them how to feel the peace that passeth understanding.
      Draw them to thee, for they, wearily labor: they are heavily laden,
      gracious Father! Oh, give them rest!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;freely come! It is the eternal
      spring of living water. It is your life, and it flows for you. Come! come!
      it is the good shepherd who calls his flock to wander by the still waters
      and in the green pastures. Will you abide outside? Then, woe! woe! when
      the night cometh, and the shepherd folds his flock, and you are not there.
      Will you seek Philosophy, and confide in that? It is a ravening wolf, and
      ere morning you are consumed. Will you lean on human pride&mdash;on your
      own sufficiency? It is a broken reed, and your fall will be forever fatal.
      Will you say there is no God?&rdquo;&mdash;his voice sank into a low,
      menacing whisper&mdash;&ldquo;will you say there is no God?&rdquo; He
      raised his hands warningly, and shook them over the congregation while he
      lowered his voice. &ldquo;Hush! hush! lest he hear&mdash;lest he mark&mdash;lest
      the great Jehovah&rdquo;&mdash;his voice swelling suddenly into loud,
      piercing tones&mdash;&ldquo;Maker of heaven and earth, Judge of the quick
      and the dead, the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the
      eternal Godhead from everlasting to everlasting, should know that you,
      pitiable, crawling worm&mdash;that you, corrupt in nature and conceived in
      sin! child of wrath and of the devil! say that there is no God! Woe, woe!
      for the Judge cometh! Woe, woe! for the gnashing of teeth and the outer
      darkness! Woe, woe! for those who crucified him, and buffeted him, and
      pierced him with thorns! Woe, woe! for the Lord our God is a just God,
      slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. But oh! when the day of mercy is
      past! Oh! for the hour&mdash;sinner, sinner, beware! beware!&mdash;when
      that anger rises like an ingulfing fiery sea, and sweeps thee away
      forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if the sea had burst into the building; for the congregation
      half rose, and a smothered cry swept over the people. Many rose upright
      with clasped hands and cried, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Praise be
      to God!&rdquo; Others lay cowering and struggling upon the seats; others
      sobbed and gazed with frantic earnestness at the face of the young
      apostle. Children with frightened eyes seized the cold hands of their
      mothers. Some fainted, but could not be borne out, so solid was the
      throng. Their neighbors loosened their garments and fanned them, repeating
      snatches of hymns, and waiting for the next word of the preacher. &ldquo;The
      Lord is dealing with his people,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;convicting
      sinners, and calling the lost sheep home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The preacher stood as if lifted by an inward power, beholding with joy the
      working of the Word, but with a total unconsciousness of himself. The
      young man seemed meek and lowly while he was about his Father&rsquo;s
      business. And after waiting for a few moments, the music of his voice
      poured out peace upon that awakened throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I
      will give you rest.&rsquo; Yes, fellow-sinners, rest. For all of us, rest.
      For the weariest, rest. For you who, just awakened, tremble in doubt,
      rest. For you, young woman, who despairest of heaven, rest. For you, young
      man, so long in the bondage of sin, rest. Oh! that I had the wings of a
      dove, for then would I fly away and be at rest. Brother, sister, it shall
      be so. To your weary soul those wings shall be fitted. Far from the world
      of grief and sin, of death and disappointment, you shall fly away. Deep in
      the bosom of your God, you shall be at rest. That dove is his holy grace.
      Those wings are his tender promises. That rest is the peace of heaven.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Come, O thou all-victorious Lord,
   Thy power to us make known;
 Strike with the hammer of thy word,
   And break these hearts of stone.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Oh that we all might now begin
   Our foolishness to mourn;
 And turn at once from every sin,
   And to the Saviour turn.

 Repentance unto life bestow,

      The clover-blossom perfumed the summer air. The scythe and the sickle
      still hung in the barn. Grass and grain swayed and whispered and sparkled
      in the sun and wind. June loitered upon all the gentle hills, and peaceful
      meadows, and winding brook sides. June breathed in the sweet-brier that
      climbed the solid stone posts of the gate-way, and clustered along the
      homely country stone wall. June blossomed in the yellow barberry by the
      road-side, and in the bright rhodora and the pale orchis in the dark
      woods. June sang in the whistle of the robin swinging on the elm and the
      cherry, and the gushing warble of the bobolink tumbling, and darting, and
      fluttering in the warm meadow. June twinkled in the keen brightness of the
      fresh green of leaves, and swelled in the fruit buds. June clucked and
      crowed in the cocks and hens that stepped about the yard, followed by the
      multitudinous peep of little chickens. June lowed in the cattle in the
      pasture. June sprang, and sprouted, and sang, and grew in all the
      sprouting and blooming, in all the sunny new life of the world.

      White among the dark pine-trees stood the old house of Pinewood&mdash;a
      temple of silence in the midst of the teeming, overpowering murmur of new
      life; of silence and darkness in the midst of jubilant sunshine and
      universal song, that seemed to press against the very windows over which
      the green blinds were drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that long wave of rich life, as it glided across the lawn and in among
      the solemn pine-trees, was a little hushed and subdued. The birds sang in
      the trees beyond&mdash;the bobolinks gushed in the meadows below. But
      there was a little space of silence about the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the large drawing-room, draped in cool-colored chintz, where once
      Gabriel Bennet and Abel Newt had seen Hope Wayne, on the table where books
      had lain like porcelain ornaments, lay a strange piece of furniture, long,
      and spreading at one end, smelling of new varnish, studded with high
      silver-headed nails, and with a lid. It was lined with satin. Yes, it was
      a casket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was more formal, and chilly, and dim than ever. Puffs of air
      crept through it as if frightened&mdash;frightened to death before they
      got out again. The smell of the varnish was stronger than that of the
      clover-blossoms, or the roses or honey-suckles outside in the fields and
      gardens, and about the piazzas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the wall hung the portrait of Christopher Burt at the age of ten,
      standing in clean clothes, holding a hoop in one hand and a book in the
      other. It was sixty-four years before that the portrait was painted, and
      if one had come searching for that boy he would have found him&mdash;by
      lifting that lid he would have seen him; but in those sunken features,
      that white hair, that startling stillness of repose, would he have
      recognized the boy of the soft eyes and the tender heart, whose June
      clover had not yet blossomed?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a creaking, crackling sound upon the gravel in the avenue, and
      then a carriage emerged from behind the hedge, and another, and another.
      They were family carriages, and stopped at the front door, which was swung
      wide open. There was no sound but the letting down of steps and slamming
      of doors, and the rolling away of wheels. People with grave faces, which
      they seemed to have put on for the occasion as they put on white gloves
      for weddings, stepped out and came up the steps. They were mostly clad in
      sober colors, and said nothing, or conversed in a low, murmuring tone, or
      in whispers. They entered the house and seated themselves in the library,
      with the large, solemn Family Bible, and the empty inkstand, and the clean
      pen-wiper, and the paper knife, and the melancholy recluses of books
      locked into their cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently some one would come to the door and beckon with his finger to
      some figure sitting in the silent library. The sitter arose and walked out
      quietly, and went with the beckoner and looked in at the lid, and saw what
      had once been a boy with soft eyes and tender heart. Coming back to the
      library the smell of varnish was for a moment blown out of the wide entry
      by the breath of the clover that wandered in, and reminded the silent
      company of the song and the sunshine and bloom that were outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length every thing was waiting. No more carriages came&mdash;no more
      people. There was no more looking into the casket&mdash;no more whispering
      and moving. The rooms were full of a silent company, and they were all
      waiting. The clock ticked audibly. The wind rustled in the pine-trees.
      What next? Would not the master of the house appear to welcome his guests?
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not come; but from the upper entry, at the head of the stairs, near
      a room in which sat Hope Wayne, and Lawrence Newt, and Mrs. Simcoe, and
      Fanny Dinks, and Alfred, and his parents, and a few others, was heard the
      voice of Dr. Peewee, saying, &ldquo;Let us pray!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he prayed a long prayer. He spoke of the good works of this life, and
      the sweet promises of the next; of the Christian hero, who fights the good
      fight encompassed by a crowd of witnesses; of those who do justice and
      love mercy, and walk in the way of the Lord. He referred to our dear
      departed brother, and eulogized Christian merchants, calling those blessed
      who, being rich, are almoners of the Lord&rsquo;s bounty. He prayed for
      those who remained, reminding them, that the Lord chastens whom he loves,
      and that they who die, although full of years and honors, do yet go where
      the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest, and at last
      pass beyond to enter into the joy of their Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice ceased, and silence fell again upon the house. Every body sat
      quietly; the women fanned themselves, and the men looked about. Here was
      again the sense of waiting&mdash;of vague expectation. What next?
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four workmen went into the parlor. One of them put down the lid
      and screwed it tight. The casket was closed forever. They lifted it, and
      carried it out carefully down the steps. They rolled it into a hearse that
      stood upon the gravel, and the man who closed the lid buttoned a black
      curtain over the casket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same man went to the front door and read several names from a paper in
      a clear, dry voice. The people designated came down stairs, went out of
      the door, and stepped into carriages. The company rose in the library and
      drawing-room, and, moving toward the hall, looked at the mourners&mdash;at
      Hope Wayne and Mrs. Simcoe, at Mr. and Mrs. Budlong Dinks, Mr. and Mrs.
      Alfred Dinks, and others, as they passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the procession began to move slowly along the avenue. Those who
      remained stepped out upon the piazza and watched it; then began to bustle
      about for their own carriages. One after another they drove away. Mr.
      Kingo said to Mr. Sutler that he believed the will was in the hands of Mr.
      Budlong Dinks, and would be opened in the morning. They looked around the
      place, and remarked that Miss Wayne would probably become its mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Alfred Dinks seems to be a very&mdash;a very&mdash;&rdquo;
      said Mr. Kingo, gravely, pausing upon the last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much so, indeed,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sutler, with equal
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Grabeau, &ldquo;if it had been so ordered
      that young Mr. Dinks should marry his cousin, Miss Wayne, he would&mdash;that
      is, I suppose he would&mdash;;&rdquo; and he too hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied both the other gentlemen, seriously,
      &ldquo;without question it would have been a very good thing. Mr. Burt
      must have left a very large property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made every cent tell,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutler, taking the reins
      and stepping into his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather&mdash;rather&mdash;a screw, perhaps?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
      Grabeau, gravely, as he took out his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awful!&rdquo; replied Mr. Kingo, as he drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last carriage went, and the stately old mansion stood behind its trees
      deserted. The casket and its contents had been borne away forever; but
      somebody had opened all the windows of the house, and June, with its song,
      and perfume, and sunshine, overflowed the silent chambers, and banished
      the smell of the varnish and every thought of death.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. &mdash; THE HEIRESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning it was hard to believe in the spectacle of the preceding
      day. The house of Pinewood was pleasantly open to the sun and air. Hope
      Wayne, in a black dress of the lightest possible texture, so thin that her
      arms could be seen through the sleeves, sat by a window. Lawrence Newt sat
      beside her. Dr. Peewee was talking with Mrs. Dinks. Her son Alfred was
      sitting alone in a chair, looking at his mother, and Mrs. Fanny Newt Dinks
      was looking out at a window upon the lawn. Mrs. Simcoe sat near Hope
      Wayne. There was a table in the middle of the room, from which every thing
      had been removed. The Honorable Budlong Dinks was walking slowly up and
      down the room; and several legal-looking gentlemen, friends of his, were
      conversing and smiling among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dinks stopped in his walk, and, leaning upon the table with the tips
      of two fingers and the thumb of his left hand, he thrust the right hand
      into his waistcoat, by the side of the ruffle of his shirt, as if he were
      about to address the house upon a very weighty question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In accordance,&rdquo; said he, with an air of respect and
      resignation, &ldquo;with the wishes of the late Christopher Burt, as
      expressed in a paper found in his secretary drawer after his decease, I am
      about to open his will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Mr. Dinks cleared his throat. Mrs. Fanny Newt Dinks turned
      back from the window, and conversation ceased. All eyes were fixed upon
      the speaker, who became more pigeon-breasted every moment. He took out his
      glasses and placed them upon his nose, and slowly surveyed the company. He
      then drew a sealed paper from his pocket, clearing his throat with great
      dignity as he did so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the document,&rdquo; said he, again glancing about the
      room. At this point Hiram stepped gently in, and stood by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dinks proceeded to break the seal as if it had been sacramental bread,
      and with occasional looks at the groups around him, opened the document&mdash;shook
      it&mdash;creased it back&mdash;smoothed it&mdash;and held it carefully in
      the attitude of reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the audience had been sufficiently impressed with this ceremony, and
      with a proper conviction of the fact that he of all other men had been
      selected to reveal the contents of that important paper to mankind, he
      began, and read that, being of sound mind and body, etc., etc.,
      Christopher Burt, etc., etc., as an humble Christian, and loving the old
      forms, gave his body to the ground, his soul to his God, in the hope of a
      happy resurrection, etc., etc.; and devised and bequeathed his property,
      etc., etc., in the manner following, to wit; that is to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Mr. Dinks paused, and blew his nose with profound gravity.
      He proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>First</i>. I give to my housekeeper, Jane Simcoe, the friend of
      my darling daughter Mary, and the life-long friend and guardian of my dear
      grand-daughter, Hope Wayne, one thousand dollars per annum, as hereinafter
      specified.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s face did not change; nobody moved except Alfred Dinks,
      who changed the position of his legs, and thought within himself&mdash;&ldquo;By
      Jove!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Second.</i> I give to Almira Dinks, the daughter of my brother
      Jonathan Burt, and the wife of Budlong Dinks, of Boston, the sum of five
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Mr. Dinks faltered. His wife half rose and sat down again&mdash;her
      face of a dark mahogany color. Fanny Newt sat perfectly still and looked
      narrowly at her father-in-law, with an expression which was very black and
      dangerous. Alfred had an air of troubled consternation, as if something
      fearful were about to happen. The whole company were disturbed. They
      seemed to be in an electrical condition of apprehension, like the air
      before a thunder-burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dinks continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Third</i>. I give to Alfred Dinks, my grand-nephew, my silver
      shoe-buckles, which belonged to his great-grandfather Burt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fourth.</i> And all the other estate, real and personal, of
      which I may die seized, I give, devise, and bequeath to Budlong Dinks,
      Timothy Kingo, and Selah Sutler, in trust, nevertheless, and for the sole
      use, behoof, and benefit of my dearly-beloved grand-daughter, Hope Wayne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dinks stopped. There were some papers annexed, containing directions
      for collecting the annuity to be paid to Mrs. Simcoe, and a schedule of
      the property. The Honorable B. Dinks looked hastily at the schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wayne&rsquo;s property will be at least a million of dollars,&rdquo;
      said he, in a formal voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few moments of utter silence. Even the legal gentlemen ceased
      buzzing; but presently the forefinger of one of them was laid in the palm
      of his other hand, and as he stated his proposition to his neighbor, a
      light conversation began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fanny Dinks Newt seemed to have been smitten. She sat crushed up, as
      it were, biting her nails nervously; her brow wrinkled incredulously, and
      glaring at her father-in-law, as he folded the paper. Her face grew
      altogether as black as her hair and her eyes; as if she might discharge a
      frightful flash and burst of tempest if she were touched or spoken to, or
      even looked at.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Dinks the elder did look at her, not at all with an air of sullen
      triumph, but, on the contrary, with a singularly inquisitive glance of
      apprehension and alarm, as if she felt that the petty trial of wits
      between them was insignificant compared with the chances of Alfred&rsquo;s
      happiness. In one moment it flashed upon her mind that the consequences of
      this will to her Alfred&mdash;to her son whom she loved&mdash;would be
      overwhelming. Good Heavens! she turned pale as she thought of him and
      Fanny together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man had merely muttered &ldquo;By Jove, that&rsquo;s too d&mdash;&mdash;
      bad!&rdquo; and flung himself out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife did not observe that her mother-in-law was regarding her; she did
      not see that her husband had left the room; she thought of no contest of
      wits, of no game she had won or lost. She thought only of the tragical
      mistake she had made&mdash;the dull, blundering crime she had committed;
      and still bowed over, and gnawing her nails, she looked sideways with her
      hard, round, black eyes, at Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heiress sat quietly by the side of her friend Lawrence Newt. She was
      holding the hand of Mrs. Simcoe, who glanced sometimes at Lawrence,
      calmly, and with no sign of regretful or revengeful remembrance. The
      Honorable Budlong Dinks was walking up and down the room, stroking his
      chin with his hand, not without a curiously vague indignation with the
      late lamented proprietor of Pinewood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange spectacle. A room full of living men and women who had
      just heard what some of them considered their doom pronounced by a dead
      man. They had carried him out of his house, cold, powerless, screwed into
      the casket. They had laid him in the ground beneath the village spire, and
      yet it was his word that troubled, enraged, disappointed, surprised, and
      envenomed them. Beyond their gratitude, reproaches, taunts, or fury, he
      lay helpless and dumb&mdash;yet the most terrible and inaccessible of
      despots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was cool and indifferent. The legal gentlemen moved about
      with a professional and indifferent air, as if they assisted at such an
      occasion as medical students at dissections. It was in the way of
      business. As Mr. Quiddy, the confidential counsel of the late lamented Mr.
      Burt, looked at Mrs. Alfred Dinks, he remarked to Mr. Baze, a younger
      member of the bar, anxious to appear well in the eyes of Quiddy, that it
      was a pity the friends of deceased parties permitted their disappointments
      to overpower them upon these occasions. Saying which, Mr. Quiddy waved his
      forefinger in the air, while Mr. Baze, in a deferential manner and tone,
      answered, Certainly, because they could not help themselves. There was no
      getting round a will drawn as that will was&mdash;here a slight bow to Mr.
      Quiddy, who had drawn the will, was interpolated&mdash;and if people didn&rsquo;t
      like what they got, they had better grin and bear it. Mr. Quiddy further
      remarked, with the forefinger still wandering in the air as if restlessly
      seeking for some argument to point, that the silver shoe-buckles which had
      so long been identified with the quaint costume of Mr. Burt, would be a
      very pretty and interesting heir-loom in the family of young Mr. Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which the eminent confidential counsel took snuff, and while he
      flirted the powder from his fingers looked at his young friend Baze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Baze said, &ldquo;Very interesting!&rdquo; and continued the
      attitude of listening for further wisdom from his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt meanwhile had narrowly watched his niece Fanny. Nobody else
      cared to approach her; but he went over to her presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Uncle Lawrence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful place, Fanny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So peaceful after the city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Lawrence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not looked at him before, but now she raised her eyes to his. She
      might as well have closed them. Dropping them, she looked upon the floor
      and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you, Fanny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked fierce. There was a snake-like stealthiness in her appearance,
      which Alfred&rsquo;s mother saw across the room and trembled. Then she
      raised her eyes again to her uncle&rsquo;s, and said, with a kind of
      hissing sneer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Uncle Lawrence, thank you for nothing. It&rsquo;s not very
      hard for you to be sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not dismayed, not even surprised by this speech, Lawrence was about to
      reply, but she struck in,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t want to hear it. I&rsquo;ve been cheated, and
      I&rsquo;ll have my revenge. As for you, my respected uncle, you have
      played your cards better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised and perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Fanny, what cards? What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that an old fox is a sly fox,&rdquo; said she, with the
      hissing sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence looked at her in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that sly old foxes who have lined their own nests can afford
      to pity a young one who gets a silver shoe-buckle,&rdquo; hissed Fanny,
      with bitter malignity. &ldquo;If Alfred Dinks were not a hopeless fool, he&rsquo;d
      break the will. Better wills than this have been broken by good lawyers
      before now. Probably,&rdquo; she added suddenly, with a sarcastic smile,
      &ldquo;my dear uncle does not wish to have the will broken?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was pondering what possible interest she thought he could
      have in the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference could it make to me in any case, Fanny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the difference of a million of dollars,&rdquo; said she, with
      her teeth set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually her meaning dawned upon Lawrence Newt. With a mingled pain, and
      contempt, and surprise, and a half-startled apprehension that others might
      have thought the same thing, and that all kinds of disagreeable
      consequences might flow from such misapprehension, he perceived what she
      was thinking of, and said, so suddenly and sharply that even Fanny
      started,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I want to marry Hope Wayne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. So does every body else. Do you suppose we have not
      known of your intimacies? Do you think we have heard nothing of your
      meetings all winter with that artist and Amy Waring, and your reading
      poetry, and your talking poetry?&rdquo; said Fanny, with infinite
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a look of singular perplexity upon the face of Lawrence Newt. He
      was a man not often surprised, but he seemed to be surprised and even
      troubled now. He looked musingly across the room to Hope Wayne, who was
      sitting engaged in earnest conversation with Mrs. Simcoe. In her whole
      bearing and aspect there was that purity and kindliness which are always
      associated with blue eyes and golden hair, and which made the painters
      paint the angels as fair women. A lambent light played all over her form,
      and to Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s eyes she had never seemed so beautiful. The
      girlish quiet which he had first known in her had melted into a sweet
      composure&mdash;a dignified serenity which comes only with experience. The
      light wind that blew in at the window by which she sat raised her hair
      gently, as if invisible fingers were touching her with airy benedictions.
      Was it so strange that such a woman should be loved? Was it not strange
      that any man should see much of her, be a great deal with her, and not
      love her? Was Fanny&rsquo;s suspicion, was the world&rsquo;s gossip,
      unnatural?
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked himself these questions as he looked at her, while a cloud of
      thoughts and memories floated through his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a close observer, who could read men&rsquo;s hearts in their faces&mdash;and
      that could be more easily done with every one else than with him&mdash;would
      have seen another expression gradually supplanting the first, or mingling
      with it rather: a look as of joy at some unexpected discovery&mdash;as if,
      for instance, he had said to himself, &ldquo;She must be very dear whom I
      love so deeply that it has not occurred to me I could love this angel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of that kind, perhaps; at least, something that brought a
      transfigured cheerfulness into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Fanny,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;I am not
      anxious to marry Miss Wayne; nor would she marry me if I asked her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose and passed across the room to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking about the future life of the mistress of this
      mansion,&rdquo; said Hope Wayne to Lawrence as he joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she wish?&rdquo; asked he; &ldquo;that is always the
      first question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go from here,&rdquo; said she, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne said it quietly. Mrs. Simcoe sat holding her hand. The three
      seemed to be all a little serious at the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunty says she has no particular desire to remain here,&rdquo; said
      Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like living in a tomb,&rdquo; said Mrs. Simcoe, turning her
      calm face to Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you sell it outright?&rdquo; asked he. Hope Wayne bent her
      head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? My own remembrances here are only gloomy. I should rather
      find or make another home. We could do it, aunty and I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it simply. Lawrence shook his head smilingly, and replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see my trustees this morning, Uncle Dinks says,&rdquo;
      continued Hope, &ldquo;and I shall propose to them to sell immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo; asked Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My best friends are in New York,&rdquo; replied she, with a tender
      color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt thought of Arthur Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my aunty,&rdquo; continued she, looking fondly at Mrs. Simcoe,
      &ldquo;I think I need not be afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lunch was brought in; and meanwhile Mr. Kingo and Mr. Sutler had been sent
      for, and arrived. Mr. Burt had not apprised them of his intention of
      making them trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell into conversation with Mr. Quiddy, and Mr. Baze, and Mr. Dinks.
      Dr. Peewee took his leave, &ldquo;H&rsquo;m ha! yes. My dear Miss Wayne, I
      congratulate you; congratulate you! h&rsquo;m ha, yes, oh yes&mdash;congratulate
      you.&rdquo; The other legal gentlemen, friends of Mr. Dinks, drove off.
      Nobody was left behind but the trustees and the family and Lawrence Newt&mdash;the
      Dinks were of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      After business had been discussed, and the heiress&mdash;the owner of
      Pinewood&mdash;had announced her wishes in regard to that property, she
      also invited the company to remain to dinner, and to divert themselves as
      they chose meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fanny Newt Dinks declined to stay. She asked her husband to call
      their carriage, and when it came to the door she made a formal courtesy,
      and did not observe&mdash;at least she did not take&mdash;the offered hand
      of Hope Wayne. But as she bowed and looked at Hope that young lady visibly
      changed color, for in the glance which Fanny gave her she seemed to see
      the face of her brother Abel; and she was not glad to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward sunset of that soft June day, when Uncle and Aunt Dinks&mdash;the
      latter humiliated and alarmed&mdash;were gone, and the honest neighbors
      were gone, Hope Wayne was sitting upon the very bench where, as she once
      sat reading, Abel Newt had thrown a shadow upon her book. But not even the
      memory of that hour or that youth now threw a shadow upon her heart or
      life. The eyes with which she watched the setting sun were as free from
      sorrow as they were from guile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was standing near the window in the library, looking up at
      the portrait that hung there, and deep into the soft, dark eyes. He had a
      trustful, candid air, as if he were seeking from it a benediction or
      consolation. As the long sunset light swept across the room, and touched
      tenderly the tender girl&rsquo;s face of the portrait, it seemed to him to
      smile tranquilly and trustingly, as if it understood and answered his
      confidence, and a deep peace fell upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And high above, from her window that looked westward&mdash;with a clearer,
      softer gaze, as if Time had cleared and softened the doubts and
      obscurities of life&mdash;Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s face was turned to the
      setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the distant dark-blue hills the June sun set&mdash;set upon three
      hearts, at least, that Time and Life had taught and tempered&mdash;upon
      three hearts that were brought together then and there, not altogether
      understanding each other, but ready and willing to understand. As it
      darkened within the library and the picture was hidden, Lawrence Newt
      stood at the window and looked upon the lawn where Hope was sitting. He
      heard a murmuring voice above him, and in the clear, silent air Hope heard
      it too. It was only a murmur mingling with the whisper of the pine-trees.
      But Hope knew what it was, though she could not hear the words. And yet
      the words were heard:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;I hold Thee with a trembling hand,
  And will not let Thee go;
Till steadfastly by faith I stand,
  And all Thy goodness know.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX. &mdash; A SELECT PARTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a pleasant evening in the same month of June Mr. Abel Newt entertained
      a few friends at supper. The same June air, with less fragrance, perhaps,
      blew in at the open windows, which looked outside upon nothing but the
      street and the house walls opposite, but inside upon luxury and ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      It mattered little what was outside, for heavy muslin curtains hung over
      the windows; and the light, the beauty, the revelry, were all within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boyish look was entirely gone now from the face of the lord of the
      feast. It was even a little sallow in hue and satiated in expression.
      There was occasionally that hard, black look in his eyes which those who
      had seen his sister Fanny intimately had often remarked in her&mdash;a
      look with which Alfred Dinks, for instance, was familiar. But the
      companions of his revels were not shrewd of vision. It was not Herbert
      Octoyne, nor Corlaer Van Boozenberg, nor Bowdoin Beacon, nor Sligo
      Moultrie, nor any other of his set, who especially remarked his
      expression; it was, oddly enough, Miss Grace Plumer, of New Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there in the pretty, luxurious rooms, prettier and more luxurious
      than they. For, at the special solicitation of Mr. Abel Newt, Mrs. Plumer
      had consented to accept an invitation to a little supper at his rooms&mdash;very
      small and very select; Mrs. Newt, of course, to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plumers arrived, and Laura Magot; but a note from mamma excused her
      absence&mdash;papa somewhat indisposed, and so forth; and Mr. Abel himself
      so sorry&mdash;but Mrs. Plumer knows what these husbands are! Meanwhile
      the ladies have thrown off their shawls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner is exquisite, and exquisitely served. Prince Abel, with royal
      grace, presides. By every lady&rsquo;s plate a pretty bouquet; the
      handsomest of all not by Miss, but by Mrs. Plumer. Flowers are every
      where. It is Grand Street, indeed, in the city; but the garden at
      Pinewood, perhaps, does not smell more sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, indeed, no perfume of the clover, which is the very
      breath of our Northern June, Mrs. Plumer; but clover does not grow in the
      city, Miss Grace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Abel begins the little speech to the mother, but his voice and face
      turn toward the daughter as it ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flowers are in glasses upon the mantle, and in vases of many-colored
      materials and of various shapes upon tables about the room. The last new
      books, in English editions often, and a few solid classics, are in sight.
      Pictures also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely Madonna!&rdquo; says Miss Plumer, as she raises her
      eyes to a beautiful and costly engraving that hangs opposite upon the
      wall; which, indeed, was intended to be observed by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is the Sistine, you know,&rdquo; says the Prince, as he
      sees that the waiter pours wine for Mrs. Plumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince forgets to mention that it is not the engraving which usually
      hangs there. Usually it is a pretty-colored French print representing
      &ldquo;Lucille,&rdquo; a young woman who has apparently very recently
      issued from the bath. Indeed there is a very choice collection of French
      prints which the young men sometimes study over their cigars, but which
      are this evening in the port-folio, which is not in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiters move very softly. The wants of the guests are revealed to them
      by being supplied. Quiet, elegance, luxury prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Newt&rdquo;&mdash;it is Mrs. Plumer, of New Orleans,
      who speaks&mdash;&ldquo;you have created Paris in Grand Street!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame, it is you who graciously bring Versailles and the
      Tuileries with you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He speaks to the mother; he looks, as he ends, again at the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter for the first time is in the sanctuary of a bachelor&mdash;of
      a young man about town. It is a character which always interests her&mdash;which
      half fascinates her. Miss Plumer, of New Orleans, has read more French
      literature of the lighter sort&mdash;novels and romances, for instance&mdash;than
      most of the young women whom Abel Newt meets in society. Her eyes are very
      shrewd, and she is looking every where to see if she shall not light upon
      some token of bachelor habits&mdash;something that shall reveal the man
      who occupies those pretty rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every where her bright eyes fall softly, but every where upon quiet,
      elegance, and luxury. There is the Madonna; but there are also the last
      winner at the Newmarket, the profile of Mr. Bulwer, and a French
      landscape. The books are good, but not too good. There is an air of candor
      and honesty in the room, united with the luxury and elegance, that greatly
      pleased Miss Grace Plumer. The apartment leads naturally up to that
      handsome, graceful, dark-haired, dark-eyed gentleman whose eye is
      following hers, while she does not know it; but whose mind has preceded
      hers in the very journey around the room it has now taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie sits beyond Miss Plumer, who is at the left of Mr. Newt.
      Upon his right sits Mrs. Plumer. The friendly relations of Abel and Sligo
      have not been disturbed. They seem, indeed, of late to have become even
      strengthened. At least the young men meet oftener; not infrequently in
      Mrs. Plumer&rsquo;s parlor. Somehow they are aware of each other&rsquo;s
      movements; somehow, if one calls upon the Plumers, or drives with them, or
      walks with them alone, the other knows it. And they talk together freely
      of all people in the world, except the Plumers of New Orleans. In Abel&rsquo;s
      room of an evening, at a late hour, when a party of youth are smoking,
      there are many allusions to the pretty Plumer&mdash;to which it happens
      that Newt and Moultrie make only a general reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dinner proceeds from delicate course to course, and the wines of
      varying hue sparkle and flow, so the conversation purls along&mdash;a
      gentle, continuous stream. Good things are said, and there is that kind of
      happy appreciation which makes the generally silent speak and the clever
      more witty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Godefroi Plumer has traveled much, and enjoys the world. She is a
      Creole, with the Tropics in her hair and complexion, and Spain in her
      eyes. She wears a Parisian headdress, a brocade upon her ample person, and
      diamonds around her complacent neck and arms. Diamonds also flash in the
      fan which she sways gently, admiring Prince Abel. Diamonds&mdash;huge
      solitaires&mdash;glitter likewise in the ears of Miss Grace. She wears
      also a remarkable bracelet of the same precious stones; for the rest, her
      dress is a cloud of Mechlin lace. She has quick, dark eyes, and an olive
      skin. Her hands and feet are small. She has filbert nails and an arched
      instep. Prince Abel, who hangs upon his wall the portrait of the last
      Newmarket victor, has not omitted to observe these details. He thinks how
      they would grace a larger house, a more splendid table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie remembers a spacious country mansion, surrounded by a
      silent plantation, somewhat fallen from its state, whom such a mistress
      would superbly restore. He looks a man too refined to wed for money,
      perhaps too indolently luxurious to love without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half hidden under the muslin drapery by the window hangs a cage with a
      canary. The bird sits silent; but as the feast proceeds he pours a shrill
      strain into the murmur of the guests. For the noise of the golden-breasted
      bird Sligo Moultrie can not hear something that is said to him by the ripe
      mouth between the solitaires. He asks pardon, and it is repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, still smiling and looking toward the window, he says, and, as he
      says it, his eyes&mdash;at which he knows his companion is looking&mdash;wander
      over the room,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very pretty cage!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes drop upon hers as they finish the circuit of the room. They say
      no more than the lips have said. And Miss Grace Plumer answers,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were going to say a very noisy bird.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bird is not very noisy,&rdquo; says the young man, his dark
      eyes still holding hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a moment of silence, during which Miss Plumer may have her fancy
      of what he means. If so, she does not choose to betray it. If her eyes are
      clear and shrewd, the woman&rsquo;s wit is not less so. It is with an air
      of the utmost simplicity that she replies,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was certainly noisy enough to drown what I was saying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a sound upon her other side as if a musical bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Plumer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head turns. This time Mr. Sligo Moultrie sees the massive dark braids
      of her hair behind. The ripe mouth half smiles upon Prince Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He holds a porcelain plate with a peach upon it, and a silver fruit-knife
      in his hand. She smiles, as if the music had melted into a look. Then she
      hears it again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the sunniest side of the sunniest peach for Miss Plumer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie can not help hearing, for the tone is not low. But, while
      he is expecting to catch the reply, Miss Magot, who sits beyond him,
      speaks to him. The Prince Abel, who sees many things, sees this; and, in a
      tone which is very low, Miss Plumer hears, and nobody else in the room
      hears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May life always be that side of a sweet fruit to her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the tone and not the words which are eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant Sligo Moultrie, who has answered Miss Magot&rsquo;s
      question, hears Miss Plumer say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, with all my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to him a warm acknowledgment for a piece of fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not speak of the bird; I spoke of the cage,&rdquo; are the
      words that Miss Plumer next hears, and from the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turns to Sligo Moultrie and says, with eyes that expect a reply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right; it is a very pretty cage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even a cage may be a home, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the canary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so turned to the basest uses,&rdquo; says Mr. Moultrie, as if
      thinking aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is roused by a little ringing laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pleasant idea of home you suggest, Mr. Moultrie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiles also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder you laugh at me; but I mean sense, for all that,&rdquo;
      he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You usually do,&rdquo; she says, sincerely, and eyes and solitaires
      glitter together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie is happy&mdash;for one moment. The next he hears the
      musical bell of that other voice again. Miss Plumer turns in the very
      middle of a word which she has begun to address to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Grace?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You observe the engraving of the Madonna?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the two cherubs below looking up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the serene sweetness of their faces?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what it is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace Plumer looks as if curiously speculating. Sligo Moultrie can not
      help hearing every word, although he pares a peach and offers it to Miss
      Magot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Grace, do you remember what I said once of honest admiration&mdash;that
      if it were eloquent it would be irresistible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace Plumer bows an assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that its mere consciousness&mdash;a sort of silent eloquence&mdash;is
      pure happiness to him who feels it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She thinks she remembers that too, although the Prince apparently forgets
      that he never said it to her before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Plumer, it seems to me the serene sweetness of that
      picture is the expression of the perfect happiness of entire admiration&mdash;that
      is to say, of love; whoever loves is like those cherubs&mdash;perfectly
      happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looks attentively at the picture, as if he had forgotten his own
      existence in the happiness of the cherubs. Grace Plumer glances at him for
      a few moments with a peculiar expression. It is full of admiration, but it
      is not the look with which she would say, as she just now said to Sligo
      Moultrie, &ldquo;You always speak sincerely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She is still looking at the Prince, when Mr. Moultrie begins again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be allowed to explain that I only meant that as a cage
      is a home, so it is often used as a snare. Do you know, Miss Grace, that
      the prettiest birds are often put into the prettiest cages to entice other
      birds? By-the-by, how lovely Laura Magot is this evening!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cuts a small piece of the peach with his silver knife and puts it into
      his mouth,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peaches are luxuries in June,&rdquo; he says, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time it is at Sligo Moultrie that Miss Grace Plumer looks fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of birds, Mr. Moultrie?&rdquo; she says, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Grace, do you know the story of the old Prince of Este?&rdquo;
      answers he, as he lays a bunch of grapes upon her plate. She pulls one
      carelessly and lets it drop again. He takes it and puts it in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; what is the story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was an old Prince of Este who had a beautiful villa and a
      beautiful sister, and nothing else in the world but a fiery eye and an
      eloquent tongue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie flushes a little, and drinks a glass of wine. Grace Plumer
      is a little paler, and more serious. Prince Abel plies Madame Plumer with
      fruit and compliments, and hears every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Grace, she was so beautiful that many a lady became her
      friend, and many of those friends sighed for the brother&rsquo;s fiery
      eyes and blushed as they heard his honeyed tongue. But he was looking for
      a queen. At length came the Princess of Sheba&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you talking of King Solomon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Plumer, only of Alcibiades. And when the Princess of Sheba
      came near the villa the Prince of Este entreated her to visit him,
      promising that the sister should be there. It was a pretty cage, I think;
      the sister was a lovely bird. And the Princess came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stops and drinks more wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! And then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, she had a very pleasant visit,&rdquo; he says, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Moultrie, is that the whole of the story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Miss Plumer; but that is as far as we have got.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to hear the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry; you won&rsquo;t like the rest so
      well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but that is my risk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> your risk,&rdquo; says Sligo Moultrie, looking at her;
      &ldquo;will you take it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; is the clear-eyed answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. The Princess came; but she did not go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How curious! Did she die of a peach-stone at the banquet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. She became Princess of Este instead of Sheba.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h,&rdquo; says Grace Plumer, in a long-drawn exclamation.
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Grace, how insatiable you are!&mdash;then I came away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did? I wouldn&rsquo;t have come away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Grace, you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t? What does that mean, Mr. Moultrie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the Princess remained.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you said. Is that all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the rest is nothing. I mean nothing new.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me hear the old story, then, Mr. Moultrie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest is merely that the Princess found that the fiery eyes
      burned her and the eloquent tongue stung her, and truly that is the whole.
      Isn&rsquo;t it a pretty story? The moral is that cages are sometimes
      traps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie becomes suddenly extremely attentive to Miss Magot. Grace
      Plumer ponders many things, and among others wonders how, when, where,
      Sligo Moultrie learned to talk in parables. She does not ask herself <i>why</i>
      he does so. She is a woman, and she knows why.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. &mdash; WINE AND TRUTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The conversation takes a fresh turn. Corlaer Van Boozenberg is talking of
      the great heiress, Miss Wayne. He has drunk wine enough to be bold, and
      calls out aloud from his end of the table,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Abel Newt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman turns his head toward his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are wondering down here how it is that Miss Wayne went away from
      New York unengaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not her confidant,&rdquo; Abel answers; and gallantly adds,
      &ldquo;I am sure, like every other man, I should be glad to be so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had the advantage of every body else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asks Abel, conscious that Grace Plumer is watching
      him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you were at school in Delafield until you were no chicken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel bows smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have known her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you know what a stunning heiress she was, and so
      handsome! How&rsquo;d you, of all men in the world, let her slip through
      your fingers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious silence follows this effusion. Corlaer Van Boozenberg is
      slightly flown with wine. Hal Battlebury, who sits near him, looks
      troubled. Herbert Octoyne and Mellish Whitloe exchange meaning glances.
      The young ladies&mdash;Mrs. Plumer is the only matron, except Mrs. Dagon,
      who sits below&mdash;smile pleasantly. Sligo Moultrie eats grapes. Grace
      Plumer waits to hear what Abel says, or to observe what he does. Mrs.
      Dagon regards the whole affair with an approving smile, nodding almost
      imperceptibly a kind of Freemason&rsquo;s sign to Mrs. Plumer, who thinks
      that the worthy young Van Boozenberg has probably taken too much wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt quietly turns to Grace Plumer, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Corlaer! There are disadvantages in being the son of a very
      rich man; one is so strongly inclined to measure every thing by money.. As
      if money were all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looks her straight in the eyes as he says it. Perhaps it is some effort
      he is making which throws into his look that cold, hard blackness which is
      not beautiful. Perhaps it is some kind of exasperation arising from what
      he has heard Moultrie say privately and Van Boozenberg publicly, as it
      were, that pushes him further than he means to go. There is a dangerous
      look of craft; an air of sarcastic cunning in his eyes and on his face. He
      turns the current of talk with his neighbors, without any other indication
      of disturbance than the unpleasant look. Van Boozenberg is silent again.
      The gentle, rippling murmur of talk fills the room, and at a moment when
      Moultrie is speaking with his neighbor, Abel says, looking at the
      engraving of the Madonna,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Grace, I feel like those cherubs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, Mr. Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am perfectly happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Grace, and for the same reason that I entirely love and
      admire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart beats violently. Sligo Moultrie turns and sees her face. He
      divines every thing in a moment, for he loves Grace Plumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Grace,&rdquo; he says, in a quick, thick tone, as if he
      were continuing a narration&mdash;&ldquo;yes, she became Princess of Este;
      but the fiery eyes burned her, and the sweet tongue stung her forever and
      ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Plumer and Mrs. Dagon are rising. There is a rustling tumult of women&rsquo;s
      dresses, a shaking out of handkerchiefs, light gusts of laughter, and
      fragments of conversation. The handsome women move about like birds, with
      a plumy, elastic motion, waving their fans, smelling their bouquets, and
      listening through them to tones that are very low. The Prince of the house
      is every where, smiling, sinuous, dark in the eyes and hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is already late, and there is no disposition to be seated. Sligo
      Moultrie stands by Grace Plumer, and she is very glad and even grateful to
      him. Abel, passing to and fro, looks at her occasionally, and can not
      possibly tell if her confusion is pain or pleasure. There is a reckless
      gayety in the tone with which he speaks to the other ladies. &ldquo;Surely
      Mr. Newt was never so fascinating,&rdquo; they all think in their secret
      souls; and they half envy Grace Plumer, for they know the little supper is
      given for her, and they think it needs no sibyl to say why, or to prophesy
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is nearly midnight, and the moon is rising. Hark!
    </p>
    <p>
      A band pours upon the silent night the mellow, passionate wail of &ldquo;Robin
      Adair.&rdquo; The bright company stands listening and silent. The festive
      scene, the hour, the flowers, the luxury of the place, the beauty of the
      women, impress the imagination, and touch the music with a softer
      melancholy. Hal Battlebury&rsquo;s eyes are clear, but his heart is full
      of tears as he listens and thinks of Amy Waring. He knows that all is in
      vain. She has told him, with a sweet dignity that made her only lovelier
      and more inaccessible, that it can not be. He is trying to believe it. He
      is hoping to show her one day that she is wrong. Listening, he follows in
      his mind the song the band is playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie feels and admires the audacious skill of Abel in crowning
      the feast with music. Grace Plumer leans upon his arm. Abel Newt&rsquo;s
      glittering eyes are upon them. It is the very moment he had intended to be
      standing by her side, to hold her arm in his, and to make her feel that
      the music which pealed in long cadences through the midnight, and streamed
      through the draped windows into the room, was the passionate entreaty of
      his heart, the irresistible pathos of the love he bore her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow Grace Plumer is troubled. She fears the fascination she enjoys.
      She dreads the assumption of power over her which she has observed in
      Abel. She recoils from the cold blackness she has seen in his eyes. She
      sees it at this moment again, in that glittering glance which slips across
      the room and holds her as she stands. Involuntarily she leans upon Sligo
      Moultrie, as if clinging to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is more music?&mdash;a lighter, then a sadder and lingering strain.
      It recedes slowly, slowly up the street. The company stand in the pretty
      parlor, and not a word is spoken. It is past midnight; the music is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming party! Mr. Newt, how much we are obliged to you!&rdquo;
      says Mrs. Godefroi Plumer, as Abel hands her into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pleasure is all mine, Madame,&rdquo; replies Mr. Newt, as he
      sees with bitterness that Sligo Moultrie stands ready to offer his hand to
      assist Miss Plumer. The footman holds the carriage door open. Miss Plumer
      can accept the assistance of but one, and Mr. Abel is resolved to know
      which one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, Miss Plumer,&rdquo; says Sligo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, Miss Grace,&rdquo; says Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter address sounds to her a little too free. She feels, perhaps,
      that he has no rights of intimacy&mdash;at least not yet&mdash;or what
      does she feel? But she gives her hand to Sligo Moultrie, and Abel bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for a delightful evening, Mr. Newt. Good-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The host bows again, bareheaded, in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-by, Mr. Moultrie,&rdquo; says the ringing voice of the
      clear-eyed girl, who remembers that Abel is listening, but who is sure
      that only Sligo can understand, &ldquo;I ought to have told you that the
      story ended differently. The Princess left the villa. Good-night!
      good-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage rattles down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Newt; a very beautiful and pleasant party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Moultrie&mdash;thank you; and pleasant dreams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Georgian skips up the street, thinking only of Grace Plumer&rsquo;s
      last words. Abel Newt stands at his door for a moment, remembering them
      also, and perfectly understanding them. The next instant he is shawling
      and cloaking the other ladies, who follow the Plumers; among them Mrs.
      Dagon, who says, softly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Abel. I like it all very well. A very proper girl! Such
      a complexion! and such teeth! Such lovely little hands, too! It&rsquo;s
      all very right. Go on, my dear. What a dreadful piece of work Fanny&rsquo;s
      made of it! I wonder you don&rsquo;t like Hope Wayne. Think of it, a
      million of dollars! However, it&rsquo;s all one, I suppose&mdash;Grace or
      Hope are equally pleasant. Good-night, naughty boy! Behave yourself. As
      for your father, I&rsquo;m afraid to go to the house lest he should bite
      me. He&rsquo;s dangerous. Good-night, dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Abel remembers with singular distinctness that it was a word, only
      one word, just a year ago to Grace Plumer&mdash;a word intended only to
      deceive that foolish Fanny&mdash;which had cost him&mdash;at least, he
      thinks so&mdash;Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bows his last guests out at the door with more sweetness in his face
      than in his soul. Returning to the room he looks round upon the ruins of
      the feast, and drinks copiously of the wine that still remains. Not at all
      inclined to sleep, he goes into his bedroom and finds a cigar. Returning,
      he makes a few turns in the room while he smokes, and stops constantly to
      drink another glass. He half mutters to himself, as he addresses the chair
      in which Grace Plumer has been sitting,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you or I going to pay for this feast, Madame? Somebody has got
      to do it. Young woman, Moultrie was right, and you are wrong. She <i>did</i>
      become Princess of Este. I&rsquo;ll pay now, and you&rsquo;ll pay
      by-and-by. Yes, my dear Grace, you&rsquo;ll pay by-and-by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He says these last words very slowly, with his teeth set, the head a
      little crouched between the shoulders, and a stealthy, sullen, ugly glare
      in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to pay now, and you shall pay by-and-by. Yes, Miss
      Grace Plumer; you shall pay for to-night and for the evening in my mother&rsquo;s
      conservatory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He strides about the room a little longer. It is one o&rsquo;clock, and he
      goes down stairs and out of the house. Still smoking, he passes along
      Broadway until he reaches Thiel&rsquo;s. He hurries up, and finds only a
      few desperate gamblers. Abel himself looks a little wild and flushed. He
      sits down defiantly and plays recklessly. The hours are clanged from the
      belfry of the City Hall. The lights burn brightly in Thiel&rsquo;s rooms.
      Nobody is sleeping there. One by one the players drop away&mdash;except
      those who remark Abel&rsquo;s game, for that is so careless and furious
      that it is threatening, threatening, whether he loses or wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loses constantly, but still plays on. The lights are steady. His eyes
      are bright. The bank is quite ready to stay open for such a run of luck in
      its favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell of the City Hall clangs three in the morning as a young man
      emerges from Thiel&rsquo;s, and hurries, then saunters, up Broadway. His
      motions are fitful, his dress is deranged, and his hair matted. His face,
      in the full moonlight, is dogged and dangerous. It is the Prince of the
      feast, who had told Grace Plumer that he was perfectly happy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. &mdash; A WARNING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few evenings afterward, when Abel called to know how the ladies had
      borne the fatigues of the feast, Mrs. Plumer said, with smiles, that it
      was a kind of fatigue ladies bore without flinching. Miss Grace, who was
      sitting upon a sofa by the side of Sligo Moultrie, said that it was one of
      the feasts at which young women especially are supposed to be perfectly
      happy. She emphasized the last words, and her bright black eyes opened
      wide upon Mr. Abel Newt, who could not tell if he saw mischievous malice
      or a secret triumph and sense release in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, gayly, &ldquo;it would be too much for me hope
      to make any ladies, and especially young ladies, perfectly happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he returned Miss Plumer&rsquo;s look with a keen glance masked in
      merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sligo Moultrie wagged his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now is conscious power!&rdquo; said Abel, with a laugh, as he
      pointed at Miss Plumer&rsquo;s companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed, but not very heartily. There appeared to be some meaning
      lurking in whatever was said; and like all half-concealed meanings, it
      seemed, perhaps, even more significant than it really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel was very brilliant, and told more and better stories than usual. Mrs.
      Plumer listened and laughed, and declared that he was certainly the best
      company she had met for a long time. Nor were Miss Plumer and Mr. Moultrie
      reluctant to join the conversation. In fact, Abel was several times
      surprised by the uncommon spirit of Sligo&rsquo;s replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Abel to himself, with a flash of the black
      eyes that was startling.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the evening he felt particularly belligerent toward Sligo Moultrie;
      and yet a close observer would have discovered no occasion in the conduct
      of the young man for such a feeling upon Abel&rsquo;s part. Mr. Moultrie
      sat quietly by the side of Grace Plumer&mdash;&ldquo;as if somehow he had
      a right to sit there,&rdquo; thought Abel Newt, who resolved to discover
      if indeed he had a right.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that visit, however, he had no chance. Moultrie sat persistently,
      and so did Abel. The clock pointed to eleven, and still they did not move.
      It was fairly toward midnight when Abel rose to leave, and at the same
      moment Sligo Moultrie rose also. Abel bade the ladies good-evening, and
      passed out as if Moultrie were close by him. But that young man remained
      standing by the sofa upon which Grace Plumer was seated, and said quietly
      to Abel,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Newt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace Plumer looked at him also, with the bright black eyes, and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Abel Newt&rsquo;s heart seemed to stand still! An expression
      of some bitterness must have swept over his face, for Mrs. Plumer stepped
      toward him, as he stood with his hand upon the door, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you unwell?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud dissolved in a forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you; not at all!&rdquo; and he looked surprised, as if he
      could not imagine why any one should think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait longer, and the next moment was in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Plumer also left the room almost immediately after his departure.
      Sligo Moultrie seated himself by his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Grace, did you see that look?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He suspects the truth,&rdquo; returned Sligo Moultrie; and he might
      have added more, but that his lips at that instant were otherwise engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel more than suspected the truth. He was sure of it, and the certainty
      made him desperate. He had risked so much upon the game! He had been so
      confident! As he half ran along the street he passed many things rapidly
      in his mind. He was like a seaman in doubtful waters, and the breeze was
      swelling into a gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning out of Broadway he ran quickly to his door, opened it, and leaped
      up stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great surprise his lamp was lighted and a man was sitting reading
      quietly at his table. As Abel entered his visitor closed his book and
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Uncle Lawrence,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;you have a
      genius for surprises! What on earth are you doing in my room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle said, only half smiling,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, we are both bachelors, and bachelors have no hours. I want to
      talk with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked at his guest uneasily; but he put down his hat and lighted a
      cigar; then seated himself, almost defiantly, opposite his uncle, with the
      table between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Sir; what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt paused a moment, while the young man still calmly puffed the
      smoke from his mouth, and calmly regarded his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, you are not a fool. You know the inevitable results of
      certain courses. I want to fortify your knowledge by my experience. I
      understand all the temptations and excitements that carry you along. But I
      don&rsquo;t like your looks, Abel; and I don&rsquo;t like the looks of
      other people when they speak of you and your father. Remember, we are of
      the same blood. Heaven knows its own mysteries! Your father and I were
      sons of one woman. That is a tie which we can neither of us escape, if we
      wanted to. Why should you ruin yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come to propose any thing for me to do, Sir, or only to
      inform me that you considered me a reprobate?&rdquo; asked Abel,
      half-sneeringly, the smoke rising from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am like other young men,&rdquo; continued Abel. &ldquo;I am fond
      of living well, of a good horse, of a pretty woman. I drink my glass, and
      I am not afraid of a card. Really, Uncle Lawrence, I see no such profound
      sin or shame in it all, so long as I honestly pay the scot. Do I cheat at
      cards? Do I lie in the gutters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I steal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Uncle Lawrence, what do you mean, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the way, the spirit in which you do things. If you are not
      conscious of it, how can I make you? I can not say more than I have. I
      came merely&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a handwriting upon the wall, Uncle Lawrence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt rose and stood a little back from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you choose, as a handwriting on the wall. Abel, when the
      prodigal son <i>came to himself</i>, he rose and went to his father. I
      came to ask you to return to yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From these husks, Sir?&rdquo; asked Abel, as he looked around his
      luxurious rooms, his eye falling last upon the French print of Lucille,
      fresh from the bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt looked at his nephew with profound gravity. The young man
      lay back in his chair, lightly holding his cigar, and carelessly following
      the smoke with his eye. The beauty and intelligence of his face, the
      indolent grace of his person, seen in the soft light of the lamp, and set
      like a picture in the voluptuous refinement of the room, touched the
      imagination and the heart of the older man. There was a look of earnest,
      yearning entreaty in his eyes as he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, you remember Milton&rsquo;s Comus?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the revelers were happy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel smiled, but did not answer. But after a few minutes he said, with a
      smile,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> there,&rdquo; answered Lawrence Newt, with uplifted
      finger, and in a voice so sad and clear that Abel started.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other silently for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Abel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Uncle Lawrence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed behind the older man. Abel sat in his chair, intently
      thinking. His uncle&rsquo;s words rang in his memory. But as he recalled
      the tone, the raised finger, the mien, with which they had been spoken,
      the young man looked around him, and seemed half startled and frightened
      by the stillness, and awe-struck by the midnight hour. He moved his head
      rapidly and arose, like a person trying to rouse himself from sleep or
      nightmare. Passing the mirror, he involuntarily started at the haggard
      paleness of his face under the clustering black hair. He was trying to
      shake something off. He went uneasily about the room until he had lighted
      a match, and a candle, with which he went into the next room, still
      half-looking over his shoulder, as if fearing that something dogged him.
      He opened the closet where he kept his wine. He restlessly filled a large
      glass and poured it down his throat&mdash;not as if he were drinking, but
      as if he were taking an antidote. He rubbed his forehead with his hand,
      and half-smiled a sickly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still his eyes wandered nervously to the spot in which his uncle had
      stood; still he seemed to fear that he should see a ghostly figure
      standing there and pointing at him; should see himself, in some phantom
      counterpart, sitting in the chair. His eyes opened as if he were listening
      intently. For in the midnight he thought he heard, in that dim light he
      thought he saw, the Prophet and the King. He did not remember more the
      words his uncle had spoken. But he heard only, &ldquo;Thou art the man!
      Thou art the man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all night long, as he dreamed or restlessly awoke, he heard the same
      words, spoken as if with finger pointed&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art the man!
      Thou art the man!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. &mdash; BREAKERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt had certainly told the truth of his brother&rsquo;s home.
      Mr. Boniface Newt had become so surly that it was not wise to speak to
      him. He came home late, and was angry if dinner were not ready, and cross
      if it were. He banged all the doors, and swore at all the chairs. After
      dinner he told May not to touch the piano, and begged his wife, for Heaven&rsquo;s
      sake, to take up some book, and not to sit with an air of imbecile vacancy
      that was enough to drive a man distracted. He snarled at the servants, so
      that they went about the house upon tip-toe and fled his presence, and
      were constantly going away, causing Mrs. Newt to pass many hours of the
      week in an Intelligence Office. Mr. Newt found holes in the carpets,
      stains upon the cloths, knocks upon the walls, nicks in the glasses and
      plates at table, scratches upon the furniture, and defects and misfortunes
      every where. He went to bed without saying good-night, and came down
      without a good-morning. He sat at breakfast morose and silent; or he
      sighed, and frowned, and muttered, and went out without a smile or a
      good-by. There was a profound gloom in the house, an unnatural order.
      Nobody dared to derange the papers or books upon the tables, to move the
      chairs, or to touch any thing. If May appeared in a new dress he frowned,
      and his wife trembled every time she put in a breast-pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in her own room was May mistress of every thing. If any body had
      looked into it he would have seen only the traces of a careful and elegant
      hand, and often enough he would have seen a delicate girl-face, almost too
      thoughtful for so young a face, resting upon the hand, as if May Newt were
      troubled and perplexed by the gloom of the house and the silence of the
      household. Her window opened over the street, and there were a few
      horse-chestnut trees before the house. She made friends with them, and
      they covered themselves with blossoms for her pleasure. She sat for hours
      at her window, looking into the trees, sewing, reading, musing&mdash;solitary
      as a fairy princess in a tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes flowers came, with Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s love. Or fine fruit
      for Miss May Newt, with the same message. Several times from her window
      May had seen who the messenger was: a young man with candid eyes, with a
      quick step, and an open, almost boyish face. When the street was still she
      heard him half-singing as he bounded along&mdash;as nobody sings, she
      thought, whose home is not happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solitary as a fairy princess in a tower, she looked down upon the figure
      as it rapidly disappeared. The sewing or the reading stopped entirely; nor
      were they resumed when he had passed out of sight. May Newt thought it
      strange that Uncle Lawrence should send such a messenger in the middle of
      the day. He did not look like a porter. He was not an office boy. He was
      evidently one of the upper-clerks. It was certainly very kind in Uncle
      Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thought the solitary Princess in the tower, her mind wandering from the
      romance she was reading to a busy speculation upon the reality in the
      street beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind was thrown partly back as she sat at the open window. A simple
      airy dress, made by her own hands, covered her flower-like figure. The
      brown hair was smoothed over the white temples, and the sweet girl eyes
      looked kindly into the street from which the figure of the young man had
      just passed. If by chance the eyes of that young man had been turned
      upward, would he not have thought&mdash;since one Sunday morning, when he
      passed her on the way to church, he was sure that she looked like an angel
      going home&mdash;would he not have thought that she looked like an angel
      bending down toward him out of heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not strange that Uncle Lawrence had sent him. For somehow Uncle
      Lawrence had discovered that if there was any thing to go to May Newt,
      there was nothing in the world that Gabriel Bennet was so anxious to do as
      to carry it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the young man was always so glad to go to Boniface Newt&rsquo;s
      gloomy house&mdash;for some reason which he did not explain, and which
      even his sister Ellen did not know&mdash;or, at least, which she pretended
      not to know, although one evening that wily young girl talked with brother
      Gabriel about May Newt, as if she had some particular purpose in the
      conversation, until she seemed to have convinced herself of some hitherto
      doubtful point&mdash;yet with all the willingness to go to the house,
      Gabriel Bennet never went to the office of Boniface Newt, Son, &amp; Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had done so it would not have been pleasant to him, for it was
      perpetual field-day in the office. A few days after Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s
      visit to his nephew, the senior partner sat bending his hard, anxious face
      over account-books and letters. The junior partner lounged in his chair as
      if the office had been a club-room. The &ldquo;Company&rdquo; never
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I&rsquo;ve just seen Sinker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; Sinker!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, father, let&rsquo;s be reasonable! Sinker says that the
      Canal will be a clear case of twenty per cent, per annum for ten years at
      least, and that we could afford to lose a cent or two upon the Bilbo iron
      to make it up, over and over again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abel Newt threw his leg over the arm of the chair and looked at his
      boot. Mr. Boniface Newt threw his head around suddenly and fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s Sinker&rsquo;s commission? How much money do you
      suppose he has to put in? How much stock will he take?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has sold out in the Mallow Mines to put in,&rdquo; said Abel, a
      little doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says so,&rdquo; returned Abel, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo; said his father, tartly,
      turning back again to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel put both hands in his pockets, and both feet upon the ground, side by
      side, and rocked them upon the heels backward and forward, looking all the
      time at his father. His face grew cloudy&mdash;more cloudy every moment.
      At length he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His father did not speak or move. He seemed to have heard nothing, and to
      be only inwardly cursing the state of things revealed by the books and
      papers before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked at him for a moment, and then, raising his voice, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As one of the firm, I propose that we sell out the Bilbo and buy
      into the Canal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a look or movement from his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel jumped up&mdash;his eyes black, his face red. He took his hat and
      went to the door, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go and conclude the arrangement!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reached the door his father raised his eyes and looked at him. The
      eyes were full of contempt and anger, and a sneering sound came from his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man glanced sideways at his parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will prevent me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; roared the elder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am one of the firm,&rdquo; said Abel, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better try it!&rdquo; said the old man, disregarding
      Abel&rsquo;s remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel was conscious that his father had this game, at least, in his hands.
      The word of the young man would hardly avail against a simultaneous veto
      from the parent. No transaction would stand a moment under such
      circumstances. The young man slowly turned from the door, and fixing his
      eyes upon his father, advanced toward him with a kind of imperious
      insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to understand my position in this house,&rdquo; said
      he, with forced calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Sir, a bootblack, if I choose!&rdquo; returned his
      father, fiercely. &ldquo;The unluckiest day of my life was when you came
      in here, Sir. Ever since then the business has been getting more and more
      complicated, until it is only a question of days how long it can even look
      respectable. We shall all be beggars in a month. We are ruined. There is
      no chance,&rdquo; cried the old man, with a querulous wail through his set
      teeth. &ldquo;And you know who has done it all. You know who has brought
      us all to shame and disgrace&mdash;to utter poverty;&rdquo; and, rising
      from his chair, the father shook his clenched hands at Abel so furiously
      that the young man fell back abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, Sir. Don&rsquo;t dare to say a word,&rdquo;
      cried Mr. Newt, in a voice shrill with anger. &ldquo;All my life has come
      to nothing. All my sacrifices, my industry, my efforts, are of no use. I
      am a beggar, Sir; so are you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank back in his chair and covered his face with his hands. The noise
      made the old book-keeper outside look in. But it was no new thing. The hot
      debates of the private room were familiar to his ear. With the silent, sad
      fidelity of his profession he knew every thing, and was dumb. Not a turn
      of his face, not a light in his eye, told any tales to the most careful
      and sagacious inquirer. Within the last few months Mr. Van Boozenberg had
      grown quite friendly with him. When they met, the President had sought to
      establish the most familiar intercourse. But he discovered that for the
      slightest hint of the condition of the Newt business he might as well have
      asked Boniface himself. Like a mother, who knows the crime her son has
      committed, and perceives that he can only a little longer hide it, but
      who, with her heart breaking, still smiles away suspicion, so the faithful
      accountant, who supposed that the crash was at hand, was as constant and
      calm as if the business were never before so prosperous.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. &mdash; SLIGO MOULTRIE <i>vice</i> ABEL NEWT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abel Newt had now had two distinct warnings of something which nobody knew
      must happen so well as he. He dined sumptuously that very day, and dressed
      very carefully that evening, and at eight o&rsquo;clock was sitting alone
      with Grace Plumer. The superb ruby was on her finger. But on the third
      finger of her left hand he saw a large glowing opal. His eyes fastened
      upon it with a more brilliant glitter. They looked at her too so strangely
      that Grace Plumer felt troubled and half alarmed. &ldquo;Am I too late?&rdquo;
      he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Grace,&rdquo; said Abel, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said she, with a half smile, as if she accepted a
      contest of badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember I said I was perfectly happy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved his chair a little nearer to hers. She drew back almost
      imperceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you <i>said</i> so, and I was very glad to hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember my theory of perfect happiness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Plumer, calmly, &ldquo;I believe it was
      perfect love. But I think we had better talk of something else;&rdquo; and
      she rose from her chair and stood by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Plumer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you who first emboldened me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a long time ago, in my mother&rsquo;s conservatory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace Plumer remembered the evening, and she replied, more softly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, Mr. Newt, that I behaved so foolishly: I was
      young. But I think we did each other no harm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm, I trust, indeed, Miss Grace,&rdquo; said Abel. &ldquo;It
      is surely no harm to love; at least, not as I love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He too had risen, and tried to take her hand. She stepped back. He pressed
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace; dear Grace!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Sir, stop!&rdquo; said his companion, drawing herself up and
      waving him back; &ldquo;I can not hear you talk so. I am engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel turned pale. Grace Plumer was frightened. He sprang forward and
      seized her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Grace, hear me but one word! You knew that I loved you, and you
      allowed me to come. In honor, in truth, before God, you are mine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She struggled to release her hand. As she looked in his face she saw there
      an expression which assured her that he was capable of saying any thing,
      of doing any thing; and she trembled to think how much she might be&mdash;how
      much any woman is&mdash;in the power of a desperate man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Newt, you must let me go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace, Grace, say that you love me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The frightened girl broke away from him, and ran toward the door. Abel
      followed her, but the door opened, and Sligo Moultrie entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sligo!&rdquo; cried Grace, as he put his arm around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel stopped and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Miss Plumer. Certainly Mr. Moultrie will understand the
      ardor of a passion which in his case has been so fortunate. I am sorry,
      Sir,&rdquo; he said, turning to Sligo, &ldquo;that my ignorance of your
      relation to Miss Plumer should have betrayed me. I congratulate you both
      from my soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed again, and before they could speak he was gone. The tone of his
      voice lingering upon their ears was like a hiss. It was a most sinister
      felicitation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV. &mdash; CLOUDS AND DARKNESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, Miss Amy&mdash;at least, we shall be friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring sat in her chamber on the evening of the day that Lawrence Newt
      had said these words. Her long rich brown hair clustered upon her
      shoulders, and the womanly brown eyes were fixed upon a handful of
      withered flowers. They were the blossoms she had laid away at various
      times&mdash;gifts of Lawrence Newt, or consecrated by his touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat musing for a long time. The womanly brown eyes were soft with a
      look of aching regret rather than of sharp disappointment. Then she rose&mdash;still
      holding the withered remains&mdash;and paced thoughtfully up and down the
      room. The night hours passed, and still she softly paced, or tranquilly
      seated herself, without the falling of a tear, and only now and then a
      long deep breath rather than a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she took all the flowers&mdash;dry, yellow, lustreless&mdash;and
      opened a sheet of white paper. She laid them in it, and the brown womanly
      eyes looked at them with yearning fondness. She sat motionless, as if she
      could not prevail upon herself to fold the paper. But at length she sank
      gradually to her knees&mdash;a sinless Magdalen; her brown hair fell about
      her bending face, and she said, although her lips did not move, &ldquo;To
      each, in his degree, the cup is given. Oh, Father! strengthen each to
      drain it and believe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose quietly and folded the paper, with the loving care and lingering
      delay with which a mother smooths the shroud that wraps her baby. She tied
      it with a pure white ribbon, so that it looked not unlike a bridal gift;
      and pressing her lips to it long and silently, she laid it in the old
      drawer. There it still remained. The paper was as white, the ribbon was as
      pure as ever. Only the flowers were withered. But her heart was not a
      flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Aunt Martha,&rdquo; said she, several months after the death
      of old Christopher Burt, &ldquo;I really think you are coming back to this
      world again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman smiled, while the older one busily drove her needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued Amy, &ldquo;here is a white collar; and you
      have actually smiled at least six times in as many months!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman still said nothing. The old sadness was in her eyes, but
      it certainly had become more natural&mdash;more human, as it were&mdash;and
      the melodramatic gloom in which she had hitherto appeared was certainly
      less obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;God leads his erring
      children through the dark valley, but he does lead them&mdash;he does not
      leave them. I did not know how deeply I had sinned until I heard the young
      man Summerfield, who came to see me even in this room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up and about, as if to catch some lingering light upon the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s preacher who made me feel that
      there was hope even for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sewed on quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank God for those two men; and for one other,&rdquo; she added,
      after a little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy only looked, she did not ask who.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence Newt,&rdquo; said Aunt Martha, calmly looking at Amy&mdash;&ldquo;Lawrence
      Newt, who came to me as a brother comes to a sister, and said, &lsquo;Be
      of good cheer!&rsquo; Amy, what is the matter with you and Lawrence Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, aunty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many months since you met here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was several months ago, aunty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha sat quietly sewing, and after some time said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is no longer a young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Martha, he is not old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still sewing, the grave woman looked at the burning cheeks of her younger
      companion. Amy did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman continued: &ldquo;When you and he went from this room
      months ago I supposed you would be his wife before now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Amy did not speak. It was not because she was unwilling to confide
      entirely in Aunt Martha, but there was something she did not wish to say
      to herself. Yet suddenly, as if lifted upon a calm, irresistible purpose&mdash;as
      a leaf is lifted upon the long swell of the sea&mdash;she said, with her
      heart as quiet as her eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think Lawrence Newt loves me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the poor leaf is lost in the trough of the sea. The next
      moment Amy Waring&rsquo;s heart beat tumultuously; she felt as if she
      should fall from her seat. Her eyes were blind with hot tears. Aunt Martha
      did not look up&mdash;did not start or exclaim&mdash;but deliberately
      threaded her needle carefully, and creased her work with her thumb-nail.
      After a little while, during which the sea was calming itself, she said,
      slowly, repeating Amy&rsquo;s words syllable by syllable,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not believe Lawrence Newt loves you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the low, firm whisper of reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you think he loves?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant of almost deathly stillness in that turbulent heart.
      For a moment the very sea of feeling seemed to be frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, and very slowly, a terrible doubt arose in Amy Waring&rsquo;s mind.
      Before this conversation every perplexity had resolved itself in the
      consciousness that somehow it must all come right by-and-by. It had never
      occurred to her to ask, Does he love any one else? But she saw now at once
      that if he did, then the meaning of his words was plain enough; and so, of
      course, he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy knew there was but one person in the world whose name could possibly
      answer that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      But had Lawrence not watched with her&mdash;and with delight&mdash;the
      progress of Arthur Merlin&rsquo;s feeling for that other?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; but if, as he watched so closely, he saw and felt how lovely that
      other was, was it so wonderful that he should love her?
    </p>
    <p>
      These things flashed through her mind as she sat motionless by Aunt
      Martha; and she said, with profound tranquillity,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly, Hope Wayne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha did not look up. She seemed to feel that she should see
      something too sad if she did so; but she asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she worthy of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo; answered Amy, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this word Aunt Martha did look up, and her eyes met Amy&rsquo;s. Amy
      Waring burst into tears. Her aunt laid aside her work, and gently put her
      arms about her niece. She waited until the first gush of feeling had
      passed, and then said, tenderly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy, it is by the heart that God leads us women to himself. Through
      love I fell; but through love, in another way, I hope to be restored. Do
      you really believe he loves Hope Wayne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the low reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Amy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women had risen, and were walking, with their arms clasped around
      each other, up and down the room. They stopped at the window and looked
      out. As they did so, their eyes fell simultaneously upon the man of whom
      they were speaking, who was standing at the back of his lofts, looking up
      at the window, which was a shrine to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she stood and smiled at me,&rdquo; he said to himself
      whenever he looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their eyes met, he smiled and waved his hand. With his eyes and head he
      asked, as when he had first seen her there,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come up?&rdquo; and he waved his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women looked at him. As Amy did so, she felt as if there had been
      a long and gloomy war; and now, in his eager eyes and waving hand, she saw
      the illumination and waving flags of victory and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled as she looked, and nodded No to him with her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Martha nodded Yes so vehemently that Lawrence Newt immediately
      disappeared from his window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed at his coming, doubtful of Aunt Martha&rsquo;s intention, Amy
      Waring suddenly cried, &ldquo;Oh! Aunt Martha!&rdquo; and was gone in a
      moment. Lawrence Newt dashed round, and knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed into the room. Some sweet suspicion had winged his feet and
      lightened his heart; but he was not quick enough. He looked eagerly about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone!&rdquo; said Aunt Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eager eyes drooped, as if light had gone out of his life also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said Aunt Martha, &ldquo;sit down. You have been
      of the greatest service to me. How can I repay you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt, who had felt during the moment in which he saw Amy at the
      window, and the other in which he had been hastening to her, that the
      cloud was about rolling from his life, was confounded by finding that it
      was an account between Aunt Martha, instead of Amy, and himself that was
      to be settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed in some confusion, but recovering in a moment, he said,
      courteously,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of nothing that you owe me in any way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence Newt,&rdquo; returned the other, solemnly, &ldquo;you have
      known my story; you knew the man to whom I supposed myself married; you
      have known of my child; you have known how long I have been dead to the
      world and to all my family and friends, and when, by chance, you
      discovered me, you became as my brother. How many an hour we have sat
      talking in this room, and how constantly your sympathy has been my support
      and your wisdom my guide!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt, whose face had grown very grave, waved his hand
      deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Let that remain
      unsaid. It can not be unforgotten. But I know your secrets too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love Amy Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face became inscrutable, and his eyes were fixed quietly upon hers.
      She betrayed no embarrassment, but continued,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy Waring loves you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden light shot into that inscrutable face. The clear eyes were veiled
      for an instant by an exquisite emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What separates you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an authority in the tone of the question which Lawrence Newt
      found hard to resist. It was an authority natural to such intimate
      knowledge of the relation of the two persons. But he was so entirely
      unaccustomed to confide in any body, or to speak of his feelings, that he
      could not utter a word. He merely looked at Aunt Martha as if he expected
      her to answer all her own questions, and solve every difficulty and doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she had resumed her sewing, and was rocking quietly in her
      chair. Lawrence Newt arose and found his tongue. He bowed in that quaint
      way which seemed to involve him more closely in himself, and to warn off
      every body else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to hear that a woman loves me from her own lips.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was perfectly kind and respectful; but Aunt Martha felt that she
      had been struck dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you from my heart,&rdquo; Lawrence Newt said to her. And
      taking her hand, he bent over it and kissed it. She sat looking at him,
      and at length said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I do any thing to show my gratitude?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already done more than I deserve,&rdquo; replied Lawrence
      Newt. &ldquo;I must go now. Good-by! God bless you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard his quick footfalls as he descended the stairs. For a long time
      the sombre woman sat rocking idly to and fro, holding her work in her
      hand, and with her eyes fixed upon the floor. She did not seem to see
      clearly, whatever it might be she was looking at. She shook out her work
      and straightened it, and folded it regularly, and looked at it as if the
      secret would pop out of the proper angle if she could only find it. Then
      she creased it and crimped it&mdash;still she could not see. Then she took
      a few stitches slowly, regarding fixedly a corner of the room as if the
      thought she was in search of was a mouse, and might at any moment run out
      of his hole and over the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after all the looking, she shook her head intelligently and fell
      quietly to work, as if the mystery were plain enough, saying to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I trust a girl&rsquo;s instinct who loves as Amy
      does? Of course she is right. Dear! dear! Of course he loves Hope Wayne.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV. &mdash; ARTHUR MERLIN&rsquo;S GREAT PICTURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin had sketched his great picture of Diana and Endymion a
      hundred times. He talked of it with his friends, and smoked scores of
      boxes of cigars during the conversations. He had completed what he called
      the study for the work, which represented, he said, the Goddess alighting
      upon Latmos while Endymion slept. He pointed out to his companions,
      especially to Lawrence Newt, the pure antique classical air of the
      composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, as he turned his head and moved his hands
      over the study as if drawing in the air, &ldquo;you know it ought somehow
      to seem silent, and cool, and remote; for it is ancient Greece, Diana, and
      midnight. You see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a vast cloud of smoke from his mouth, as if to assist the eyes
      of the spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I see,&rdquo; said every one of his companions&mdash;especially
      Lawrence Newt, who did see, indeed, but saw only a head of Hope Wayne in a
      mist. The Endymion, the mountain, the Greece, the antiquity, were all
      vigorous assumptions of the artist. The study for his great picture was
      simply an unfinished portrait of Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Winnifred, who sometimes came into her nephew&rsquo;s studio, saw the
      study one day, and exclaimed, sorrowfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Arthur! Arthur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who was busily mixing colors upon his pallet, and humming,
      as he smoked, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis my delight of a shiny night,&rdquo; turned
      in dismay, thinking his aunt was suddenly ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt!&rdquo; and he laid down his pallet and ran toward
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting in an armchair holding the study. Arthur stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Arthur, now I understand all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin was confused. He, perhaps, suspected that his picture of
      Diana resembled a certain young lady. But how should Aunt Winnifred know
      it, who, as he supposed, had never seen her? Besides, he felt it was a
      disagreeable thing, when he was and had been in love with a young lady for
      a long time, to have his aunt say that she understood all about it. How
      could she understand all about it? What right has any body to say that she
      understands all about it? He asked himself the petulant question because
      he was very sure that he himself did not by any means understand all about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you understand, Aunt Winnifred?&rdquo; demanded Arthur, in
      a resolute and defiant tone, as if he were fully prepared to deny every
      thing he was about to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; continued Aunt Winnifred, musingly, and in a tone
      of profound sadness, as she still held and contemplated the picture&mdash;&ldquo;yes;
      yes! I see, I see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was quite vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now really my dear aunt,&rdquo; said he, remonstratingly, &ldquo;you
      must be aware that it is not becoming in a woman like you to go on in this
      way. You ought to explain what you mean,&rdquo; he added, decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my poor boy, the hotter you get the surer I am. Don&rsquo;t
      you see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merlin did not seem to be in the least pacified by this reply. It was,
      therefore, in an indignant tone that he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Winnifred, it is not kind in you to come up here and make me
      lose my time and temper, while you sit there coolly and talk in infernal
      parables!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infernal parables!&rdquo; cried the lady, in a tone of surprise and
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Arthur, Arthur! that comes of not going to church. Infernal
      parables! My soul and body, what an awful idea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled. The contest was too utterly futile. He went slowly
      back to his easel, and, after a few soothing puffs, began again to rub his
      colors upon the pallet. He was humming carelessly once more, and putting
      his brush to the canvas before him, when his aunt remarked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Arthur! now that you are reasonable, I&rsquo;ll tell you
      what I meant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist looked over his shoulder and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, dear aunt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand now why you don&rsquo;t go to our church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a remark so totally unexpected that Arthur stopped short and turned
      quite round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Aunt Winnifred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said she, holding up the study as if to overwhelm
      him with resistless proof, &ldquo;I mean, Arthur&mdash;and I could cry as
      I say it&mdash;that you are a Roman Catholic!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Winnifred, who was an exemplary member of the Dutch Reformed Church,
      or, as Arthur gayly called her to her face, a Dutch Deformed Woman, was
      too simple and sincere in her religious faith to tolerate with equanimity
      the thought that any one of the name of Merlin should be domiciled in the
      House of Sin, as she poetically described the Church of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur! Arthur! and your father a clergyman. It&rsquo;s too
      dreadful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the tender-hearted woman burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still weeping, she waved the picture in melancholy confirmation of her
      assertion. Arthur was amused and perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt, what has put such a droll idea into your head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;because,&rdquo; said Aunt Winnifred, sobbing and
      wiping her eyes, &ldquo;because this picture, which you keep locked up so
      carefully, is a picture of the Holy Virgin. Oh dear! just to think of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fresh burst of feeling from the honest and affectionate woman,
      who felt that to be a Roman Catholic was to be visibly sealed and stamped
      for eternal woe. But there was an answering burst of laughter from Arthur,
      who staggered to a sofa, and lay upon his back shouting until the tears
      also rolled from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His aunt stopped, appalled, and made up her mind that he was not only a
      Catholic but a madman. Then, as Arthur grew more composed, he and his aunt
      looked at each other for some moments in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt, you are right. It is the Holy Virgin!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Arthur,&rdquo; she groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my Madonna!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; sighed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the face I worship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur! Arthur!&rdquo; and his aunt despairingly patted her knees
      slowly with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her name is not Mary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Winnifred looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Diana.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana?&rdquo; echoed his aunt, as if she were losing her mind.
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg your pardon. Then it&rsquo;s only a portrait after all?
      Yes, yes. Diana who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin curled one foot under him as he sat, and, lighting a fresh
      cigar, told Aunt Winnifred the lovely legend of Latmos&mdash;talking of
      Diana and Endymion, and thinking of Hope Wayne and Arthur Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Winnifred listened with the utmost interest and patience. Her nephew
      was eloquent. Well, well, thought the old lady, if interest in his pursuit
      makes a great painter, my dear nephew will be a great man. During the
      course of the story Arthur paused several times, evidently lost in reverie&mdash;perhaps
      tracing the analogy. When he ended there was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
      Then Aunt Winnifred looked kindly at him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, as he uncurled his leg, and with a half
      sigh, as if it were pleasanter to tell old legends of love than to paint
      modern portraits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the whole?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the whole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; but Arthur, did she marry him after all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked wistfully a moment at his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry him! Bless you, no, Aunt Winnifred. She was a goddess.
      Goddesses don&rsquo;t marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Winnifred did not answer. Her eyes softened like eyes that see days
      and things far away&mdash;like eyes in which shines the love of a heart
      that, under those conditions, would rather not be a goddess.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI. &mdash; REDIVIVUS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ellen Bennet, like May Newt, was a child no longer&mdash;hardly yet a
      woman, or only a very young one. Rosy cheeks, and clustering hair, and
      blue eyes, showed only that it was May&mdash;June almost, perhaps&mdash;instead
      of gusty March or gleaming April.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; said Gabriel, in a low voice&mdash;while his mother,
      who was busily sewing, conversed in a murmuring undertone with her
      husband, who sat upon the sofa, slowly swinging his slippered foot&mdash;&ldquo;Ellen,
      Lawrence Newt didn&rsquo;t say that he should ask Edward to his dinner on
      my birthday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen&rsquo;s cheeks answered&mdash;not her lips, nor her eyes, which were
      bent upon a purse she was netting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think he will,&rdquo; added Gabriel. &ldquo;I think I have
      mistaken Lawrence Newt if he does not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is usually very thoughtful,&rdquo; whispered Ellen, as she
      netted busily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen, how handsome Edward is!&rdquo; said Gabriel, with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how good!&rdquo; added Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; she answered, scarcely audibly. Then she said she had
      left something up stairs. How many things are discovered by young women,
      under certain circumstances, to have been left up stairs! Ellen rose and
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying to your father, Gabriel,&rdquo; said his mother,
      raising her voice, and still sewing, &ldquo;that Edward comes here a great
      deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother; and I am glad of it. He has very few friends in the
      city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a Spaniard,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, slowly, dwelling
      upon every word. &ldquo;How rich that lustrous tropical complexion is! Its
      duskiness is mysterious. The young man&rsquo;s eyes are like summer
      moonlight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s own eyes half closed as he spoke, as if he were
      dreaming of gorgeous summer nights and the murmur of distant music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel and his mother were instinctively silent. The click of her needle
      was the only sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, yes&mdash;that is&mdash;I mean, my dear, he does come here
      very often. I do go off on such foolish fancies!&rdquo; remarked Mr.
      Bennet, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes very often when you are not at home, Gabriel,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Bennet, after a kind glance at her husband, and still sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t only to see you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And often when your father and I return from an evening stroll in
      the streets we find him here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t to see us altogether, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet turned her work, and in so doing glanced for a moment at her
      son. His eyes were upon her face, but he seemed to have said all he had to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always feel,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, in a tone and with an
      expression as if he were looking at something very far away, &ldquo;as if
      King Arthur must have lived in the tropics. There is that sort of weird,
      warm atmosphere in the romance. Where is Ellen? Shall we read some more in
      this little edition of the old story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand, as he spoke, upon a small copy of old Malory&rsquo;s
      Romance of Arthur. It was a kind of reading of which he was especially
      fond, and to which the rest were always willing and glad to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Ellen,&rdquo; said he to Gabriel; &ldquo;and now then for King
      Arthur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the door-bell rang. The next moment a young man, apparently of
      Gabriel&rsquo;s age, entered the room. His large melancholy black eyes,
      the massive black curls upon his head, the transparent olive complexion, a
      natural elegance of form and of movement&mdash;all corresponded with what
      Mr. Bennet had been saying. It was evidently Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Little Malacca!&rdquo; cried Gabriel, gayly, as he
      rose and put out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Gabriel!&rdquo; he answered, in a soft, ringing
      voice; then bowed and spoke to Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel doesn&rsquo;t forget old school-days,&rdquo; said the
      new-comer to Mrs. Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has often told us of his friendship with Little Malacca,&rdquo;
      returned the lady calmly, as she resumed her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how little I thought I was to see him when I came to Mr. Newt&rsquo;s
      store,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you first know Mr. Lawrence Newt?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember when I didn&rsquo;t know him, Madam,&rdquo;
      replied Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy fellow!&rdquo; said Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Miss Ellen had probably found the mysterious something which she
      had left up stairs; for she entered the room, and bowed very calmly upon
      seeing Edward, and, seating herself upon the side of the table farthest
      from him, was presently industriously netting. As for Edward, he had
      snapped a sentence in the middle as he rose and bowed to her, and could
      not possibly fit the two ends together when he sat down again, and so lost
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, as the evening wore on, the conversation threatened to divide
      itself into <i>têtes-à-tête</i>; for Gabriel suddenly discovered that he
      had an article upon Hemp to read in the Encyclopedia which he had recently
      purchased, and was already profoundly immersed in it, while Mr. and Mrs.
      Bennet resumed their murmuring talk, and the chair of the youth with the
      large black eyes, somehow&mdash;nobody saw how or when&mdash;slipped round
      until it was upon the same side of the table with that of Ellen, who was
      busily netting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet was conscious that the chair had gone round, and the swimming
      eyes of her husband lingered with pleasure upon the mass of black curls
      bent toward the golden hair which was bowed over that intricate purse.
      Ellen was sitting under that portrait of the lady, with the flashing,
      passionate eyes, who seemed to bear a family likeness to Mrs. Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more closely he looked at the handsome youth and the lovely girl the
      more curious Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s eyes became. He watched the two with such
      intentness that his wife several times looked up at him surprised when she
      received no answer to her remarks. Evidently something had impressed Mr.
      Bennet exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife bent her head a little nearer to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, did you never see a pair of lovers before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his dreaming eyes at that, smiled, and pressed his lips silently
      to the face which was so near his own that if it had been there for the
      express purpose of being caressed it could hardly have been nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then slipping his arm around her waist, Mr. Bennet drew his wife toward
      him and pointed with his head, but so imperceptibly that only she
      perceived it, toward the young people, as if he saw something more than a
      pair of lovers. The fond woman&rsquo;s eyes followed her husband&rsquo;s.
      Gradually they became as intently fixed as his. They seemed to be
      curiously comparing the face of the young man who sat at their daughter&rsquo;s
      side with the face of the portrait that hung above her head. Mrs. Bennet
      grew perceptibly paler as she looked. The unconscious Edward and Ellen
      murmured softly together. She did not look at him, but she felt the light
      of his great eyes falling upon her, and she was not unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; began Mr. Bennet in a low tone, still studying the
      face and the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said his wife, softly, laying her head upon his
      shoulder; &ldquo;I see it all, I am sure of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel turned at this moment from his Encyclopedia. He looked intently
      for some time at the group by the table, as if studying all their
      thoughts, and then said, gravely, in a loud, clear voice, so that Ellen
      dropped a stitch, Edward stopped whispering, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet sat
      erect,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I knew how it was. It says distinctly, &lsquo;This plant
      is supposed to be a native of India; but it has long been naturalized and
      extensively cultivated elsewhere, particularly in Russia, where it forms
      an article of primary importance.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII. &mdash; DINING WITH LAWRENCE NEWT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gabriel Bennett was not confident that Edward Wynne would be at the
      birthday dinner given in his honor by Lawrence Newt, but he was very sure
      that May Newt would be there, and so she was. It was at Delmonico&rsquo;s;
      and a carriage arrived at the Bennets&rsquo; just in time to convey them.
      Another came to Mr. Boniface Newt&rsquo;s, to whom brother Lawrence
      explained that he had invited his daughter to dinner, and that he should
      send a young friend&mdash;in fact, his confidential clerk, to accompany
      Miss Newt. Brother Boniface, who looked as if he were the eternally
      relentless enemy of all young friends, had nevertheless the profoundest
      confidence in brother Lawrence, and made no objection. So the hero of the
      day conducted Miss May Newt to the banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hero of the day was so engaged in conversation with Miss May Newt that
      he said very little to his neighbor upon the other side, who was no other
      than Hope Wayne. She had been watching very curiously a young man with
      black curls and eyes, who seemed to have words only for his neighbor, Miss
      Ellen Bennet. She presently turned and asked Gabriel if she had never seen
      him before. &ldquo;I have, surely, some glimmering remembrance of that
      face,&rdquo; she said, studying it closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her question recalled a day which was strangely remote and unreal in
      Gabriel&rsquo;s memory. He even half blushed, as if Miss Wayne had
      reminded him of some early treason to a homage which he felt in the very
      bottom of his heart for his blue-eyed neighbor. But the calm, unsuspicious
      sweetness of Hope Wayne&rsquo;s face consoled him. He looked at her for a
      moment without speaking. It was really but a moment, yet, as he looked, he
      lay in a heavily-testered bed&mdash;he heard the beating of the sea upon
      the shore&mdash;he saw the sage Mentor, the ghostly Calypso putting aside
      the curtain&mdash;for a moment he was once more the little school-boy,
      bruised and ill at Pinewood; but this face&mdash;no longer a girl&rsquo;s
      face&mdash;no longer anxious, but sweet, serene, and tender&mdash;was this
      the half-haughty face he had seen and worshipped in the old village church&mdash;the
      face whose eyes of sympathy, but not of love, had filled his heart with
      such exquisite pain?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man, Miss Wayne, is Edward Wynne,&rdquo; he said, in
      reply to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem to resolve her perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall the name,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I think
      he must remind me of some one I have known.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is as black as Abel Newt,&rdquo; said Gabriel, looking with his
      clear eyes at Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But much handsomer than Mr. Newt now is,&rdquo; she answered, with
      perfect unconcern. &ldquo;His eyes are softer; and, in fact,&rdquo; she
      said, smiling pleasantly, &ldquo;I am not surprised to see what a willing
      listener his neighbor is. I wish I could recall him. I don&rsquo;t think
      that he resembles Mr. Newt at all, except in complexion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin heard every word, and watched every movement, and marked
      every expression of Hope Wayne&rsquo;s, at whose other hand he sat, during
      this little remark. Gabriel said, in reply to it,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, Miss Wayne, you have seen him before. The first time
      you ever saw me he was with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clear eyes of the young man were turned full upon her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He was your
      friend in that terrible battle with Abel Newt. It seems long ago, does it
      not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However far away it may have seemed, it was apparently a remembrance that
      roused no especial emotion in Miss Hope Wayne&rsquo;s heart. Having
      satisfied herself, she released the attention of Gabriel, who had other
      subjects of conversation with May Newt than his quarrel with her brother
      for the favor of Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur Merlin observed that while Hope Wayne listened with her ears to
      him, with her eyes she listened to Lawrence Newt. His simple, unselfish,
      and therefore unconscious urbanity&mdash;his genial, kindly humor&mdash;and
      the soft, manly earnestness of his face, were not unheeded&mdash;how could
      they be?&mdash;by her. Since the day the will was read he had been a
      faithful friend and counselor. It was he who negotiated for her house. It
      was he who daily called and gave her a thousand counsels in the details of
      management, of which every woman who comes into a large property has such
      constant need. And in all the minor arrangements of business she found in
      him the same skill and knowledge, combined with a womanly reserve and
      softness, which had first so strongly attracted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet his visits as financial counsel, as he called himself, did not
      destroy, they only heightened, the pleasure of the meetings of the Round
      Table. For the group of friends still met. They talked of poetry still.
      They talked of many things, and perhaps thought of but a few. The pleasure
      to all of them was evident enough; but it seemed more perplexed than
      formerly. Hope Wayne felt it. Amy Waring felt it. Arthur Merlin felt it.
      But not one of them could tell whether Lawrence Newt felt it. There was a
      vague consciousness of something which nearly concerned them all, but not
      one of them could say precisely what it was&mdash;except, possibly, Amy
      Waring; and except, certainly, Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Aunt Martha&rsquo;s question had drawn from Amy&rsquo;s lips what had
      lain literally an unformed suspicion in her mind, until it leaped to life
      and rushed armed from her mouth. Amy Waring saw how beautiful Hope Wayne
      was. She knew how lovely in character she was. And she was herself
      beautiful and lovely; so she said in her mind at once, &ldquo;Why have I
      never seen this? Why did I not know that he must of course love her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, if she reminded herself of the conversation she had held with
      Lawrence Newt about Arthur Merlin and Hope Wayne, she was only perplexed
      for a moment. She knew that he could not but be honest; and she said
      quietly in her soul, &ldquo;He did not know at that time how well worthy
      his love she was.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVIII. &mdash; THE HEALTH OF THE JUNIOR PARTNER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call for a bumper!&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, when the fruit was
      placed upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glasses were filled, and the host glanced around his table. He did not
      rise, but he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, commercial honesty is not impossible, but it
      is rare. I do not say that merchants are worse than other people; I only
      say that their temptations are as great, and that an honest man&mdash;a
      man perfectly honest every how and every where&mdash;is a wonder. Whatever
      an honest man does is a benefit to all the rest of us. If he become a
      lawyer, justice is more secure; if a doctor, quackery is in danger; if a
      clergyman, the devil trembles; if a shoemaker, we don&rsquo;t wear rotten
      leather; if a merchant, we get thirty-six inches to the yard. I have been
      long in business. I have met many honest merchants. But I know that
      &lsquo;tis hard for a merchant to be honest in New York. Will you show me
      the place where &lsquo;tis easy? When we are all honest because honesty is
      the best policy, then we are all ruined, because that is no honesty at
      all. Why should a man make a million of dollars and lose his manhood? He
      dies when he has won them, and what are the chances that he can win his
      manhood again in the next world as easily as he has won the dollars in
      this? For he can&rsquo;t carry his dollars with him. Any firm, therefore,
      that gets an honest man into it gets an accession of the most available
      capital in the world. This little feast is to celebrate the fact that my
      firm has been so enriched. I invite you to drink the health of Gabriel
      Bennet, junior partner of the firm of Lawrence Newt &amp; Co.!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of perfect silence. Then every body looked at Gabriel
      except his mother, whose eyes were so full of tears that she could see
      nothing. Gabriel himself was entirely surprised. He had had no hint from
      Lawrence Newt of this good fortune. He had worked faithfully, constantly,
      and intelligently&mdash;honestly, of course&mdash;that was all Gabriel
      knew about his position. He had been for some time confidential clerk, so
      that he was fully cognizant of the state of the business, and knew how
      prosperous it was. And yet, in this moment of delight and astonishment, he
      had but one feeling, which seemed entirely alien and inadequate to the
      occasion, for it was merely the hope that now he might be a regular
      visitor at the house of Boniface Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne&rsquo;s eye had hung upon Lawrence Newt, during the little
      speech he had made, so intently, that Arthur Merlin&rsquo;s merriment had
      been entirely checked. He found himself curiously out of spirits. Until
      that moment, and especially after the little conversation between Hope and
      Gabriel, in which Abel Newt&rsquo;s name had been mentioned, Arthur had
      thought it, upon the whole, the pleasantest little dinner he had ever
      known. He was not of the same opinion now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Wynne and Ellen Bennet showed entire satisfaction with the dinner,
      and especially with Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s toast. And when the first hum of
      applause and pleasure had ceased, Edward cried out lustily,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A speech from the junior partner! A speech! a speech!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general call. Gabriel could not help rising, and blushing, and
      bowing, and stuttering, and sitting down again, amidst tempestuous
      applause, without the slightest coherent idea of what he had said, except
      that he was very happy, and very glad, and very sure, and very, etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not care a song for what he had said, nor for the applause that
      greeted it, when he saw certain blue eyes glistening, and a soft shyness
      upon certain cheeks and lips, as if they had themselves been speaking, and
      had been saying&mdash;what was palpably, undeniably, conspicuously true&mdash;that
      they were very happy, and very glad, and very sure, and very, etc., etc.
      Very, indeed!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX. &mdash; MRS. ALFRED DINKS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was but a few days after the dinner that the junior partner was taking
      the old path that led under the tower of the fairy princess, when lo! he
      met her in the way. In her eyes there was that sweet light of expectation
      and happiness which illuminated all Gabriel&rsquo;s thoughts of her, and
      persuaded him that he was the happiest and unworthiest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, May?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Fanny&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May Newt looked at him and said, gravely, &ldquo;No, I am going to ask
      Little Malacca to go with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gabriel Bennet, with equal
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What splendid, melancholy eyes he has!&rdquo; said May, with
      unusual ardor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do, and such hair! Why, Mr. Bennet, did you ever see
      such magnificent hair&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you like black hair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his voice&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, May&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What merry light in the fairy eyes! What dazzling splendor of love and
      happiness in the face that turned to his as he laid her arm in his own!
      One would have thought she, too, had been admitted a junior partner in
      some most prosperous firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed along the street, which was full of people, and Gabriel and
      May unconsciously looked at the crowd with new eyes and thoughts. Can it
      be possible that all these people are so secretly happy as two that we
      know? thought they. &ldquo;All my life,&rdquo; said Gabriel to himself,
      without knowing it, &ldquo;have I been going up and down, and never
      imagined how much honey there was hived away in all the hearts of which I
      saw only the rough outside?&rdquo; &ldquo;All my life,&rdquo; mused May,
      with sweet girl-eyes, &ldquo;have I passed lovers as if they were mere men
      and women?&rdquo; And under her veil, where no eye could see, her cheek
      was flushed, and her eyes were sweeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed up Broadway and turned across to the Bowery. Crossing the
      broad pavement of the busy thoroughfare, they went into a narrow street
      beyond, and so toward the East River. At length they stopped before a low,
      modest house near a quiet corner. A sloppy kitchen-maid stood upon the
      area steps abreast of the street. A few miserable trees, pining to death
      in the stone desert of the town, were boxed up along the edge of the
      sidewalk. A scavenger&rsquo;s cart was joggling along, and a little
      behind, a ragman&rsquo;s wagon with a string of jangling bells. The smell
      of the sewer was the chief odor, and the long lines of low, red brick
      houses, with wooden steps and balustrades, and the blinds closed,
      completed a permanent camp of dreariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Fanny Newt live there?&rdquo; asked Gabriel, in a tone which
      indicated that there might be hearts in which honey was not abundantly
      hived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said May, gravely. &ldquo;You know they have very
      little to live upon, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh dear, I don&rsquo;t like to
      speak of it, Gabriel, but they are very miserable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel said nothing, but rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sloppy servant having stared wildly for a moment at the apparition of
      blooming love that had so incomprehensibly alighted upon the steps, ducked
      under them, and in a moment reappeared at the door. She seemed to
      recognize May, and said &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m&rdquo; before any question had
      been asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel and May walked into the little parlor. It was dark and formal.
      There was a black haircloth sofa with wooden edges all over it, so that
      nobody could lean or lounge, or do any thing but sit uncomfortably
      upright. There were black haircloth chairs, a table with two or three
      books; two lamps with glass drops upon the mantle; a thin cheap carpet;
      gloom, silence, and a complicated smell of grease&mdash;as if the ghosts
      of all the wretched dinners that had ever been cooked in the house haunted
      it spitefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      While May went up stairs to find Fanny, Gabriel Bennet looked and smelled
      around him. He had not believed that a human home could be so dismal, and
      he could not understand how haircloth furniture and dimness could make it
      so. His father&rsquo;s house was certainly not very large; and it was
      scantily and plainly furnished, but no Arabian palace had ever seemed so
      splendid to his imagination as that home was dear to his heart. No, it isn&rsquo;t
      the furniture nor the smell, thought he. I am quite sure it is something
      that I neither see nor smell that makes the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat on the uncomfortable sofa and heard the jangling bells of the
      ragman die away into the distance, and the loud, long, mournful whoop of
      the chimney-sweep, his fancy was busy with the figures of a thousand
      things that might be&mdash;of a certain nameless somebody, mistress of
      that poor, sombre house, but so lighting it up with grace and gay
      sweetness that the hard sofa became the most luxurious lounge, and the
      cheap table more gorgeous than ormolu; and of a certain other nameless
      somebody coming home at evening&mdash;an opening door&mdash;a rustle in
      the hall as of women&rsquo;s robes&mdash;a singular sound as of meeting
      lips&mdash;then a coming together arm in arm into the dingy furnished
      little parlor, but with such a bright fire blazing under the wooden mantle&mdash;and
      then&mdash;and then&mdash;a pattering of little feet down the stairs&mdash;Hem!
      hem! said Gabriel Bennet, clearing his throat, as if to arouse himself by
      making a noise. For there was a sound of feet upon the stairs, and the
      next moment May and her sister Fanny entered the room. Gabriel rose and
      bowed, and held out his hand. Mrs. Alfred Dinks said, &ldquo;How do you
      do?&rdquo; and seated herself without taking the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time had not softened her face, but sharpened it, and her eyes were of a
      fierce blackness. She looked forty years old; and there was a permanent
      frown of her dark brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this silly May is going to marry you?&rdquo; said she,
      addressing Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprised by this kind of congratulation, but also much amused by it, as
      if there could be nothing so ludicrous as the idea of May not marrying a
      man who loved her as he loved, Gabriel gravely responded,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, she is set upon it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Newt, who had seated herself with an air of utter and chronic
      contempt and indifference, and who looked away from Gabriel the moment she
      had spoken to him, now turned toward him again suddenly with an expression
      like that of an animal which pricks up his ears. The keen fire of the old
      days shot for a moment into her eyes, for it was the first word of
      badinage or humor that Fanny Newt had heard for a long, long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman who is such a fool as to marry ought to be unhappy,&rdquo;
      she replied, with her eyes fixed upon Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who persuades her to do it ought to be taken out and hung,&rdquo;
      answered he, with aphoristic gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better to be the slave of a parent than a husband,&rdquo; she
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d lock him out,&rdquo; retorted Gabriel, with pure
      irrelevancy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d scotch his sheets; I&rsquo;d pour water in
      his boots; I&rsquo;d sift sand in his hair-brush; I&rsquo;d spatter
      vitriol on his shirts. A man who marries a woman deserves nothing better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wagged his foot carelessly, took up one of the books upon the table,
      and looked into it indifferently. Fanny Newt turned to her sister, who sat
      smiling by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with this man?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Alfred Dinks,
      audibly, of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a pregnant text, my dear Mrs. Dinks, <i>née</i> Newt, a
      name which I delight to pronounce,&rdquo; said Gabriel, striking in before
      May could reply, with the lightest tone and the soberest face in the
      world, &ldquo;which instructs us to answer a fool according to his folly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was really confounded. She had heard Abel in old days speak of
      Gabriel Bennet as a spooney&mdash;a saint in the milk&mdash;a goodsey,
      boodsey, booby&mdash;a sort of youth who would turn pale and be snuffed
      out by one of her glances. She found him incomprehensible. She owed him
      the first positive emotion of human interest she had known for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Newt looked and listened without speaking. The soft light glimmered in
      her eyes, for she knew what it all meant. It meant precisely what her
      praises of Little Malacca meant. It meant that she and Gabriel loved each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The junior partner was still holding the book when a heavy step was heard
      in the entry. Fanny&rsquo;s eyes grew darker and the frown deeper. There
      was a blundering movement outside&mdash;a hat fell&mdash;a cane struck
      something&mdash;and Gabriel knew as perfectly as if he could look through
      the wall what kind of man was coming. The door opened with a burst, and
      Mr. Alfred Dinks stopped as his eye fell upon the company. A heavy,
      coarse, red-faced, dull-eyed man, with an air of brutish obstinacy in
      every lineament and movement, he stared for a moment without a word or
      sign of welcome, and then looking at his wife, said, in a grunting, surly
      tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here; don&rsquo;t be fooling round. The old man&rsquo;s bust
      up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He banged the door violently to, and they heard his clumsy footsteps
      creaking up the stairs.

      &ldquo;In course; I sez to ma&mdash;why, Lord bless me, it must have been

      President Van Boozenberg thus unburdened his mind and justified his
      vaticinations to the knot of gentlemen who were perpetually at the bank.
      They listened, and said ah! and yes, and shook their heads; and the shaky
      ones wondered whether the astute financier had marked them and had said to
      ma, sez he, that for all they looked so bright and crowded canvas so
      smartly, they are shaky, ma&mdash;shaky.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch heard the news at his office. He was sitting on the end of
      his back-bone, which was supported on the two hind legs of a wooden chair,
      while the two fore legs and his own were lifted in the air. His own,
      however, went up at a more precipitate angle and rested with the feet
      apart upon the mantle. By a skillful muscular process the General ejected
      tobacco juice from his mouth, between his legs, and usually lodged it in
      the grate before him. It was evident, however, that many of his friends
      had not been so successful, for the grate, the hearth, and the neighboring
      floor were spotted with the fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Mr. Ele was engaged in conversation with his friend Belch,
      who was giving him instructions for the next Congressional session.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Ele, if we could only send something of the right stamp&mdash;the
      right stamp, I say, in the place of Watkins Bodley from the third
      district, we should be all right. Bodley is very uncertain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; returned the Honorable Mr. Ele, &ldquo;Bodley is not
      sound. He has not the true party feeling. He is not willing to make
      sacrifices. And yet I think that&mdash;that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at General Belch inquiringly. That gentleman turned, beamed
      approval, and squirted a copious cascade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Mr. Ele, &ldquo;I was saying that I think if
      Mr. Bodkins, who is a perfectly honorable man&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perfectly; nothing against his character. Besides, it&rsquo;s a
      free country, and every body may have his opinions,&rdquo; said General
      Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Ele, &ldquo;as I was saying; being a
      perfectly honorable man&mdash;in fact, unusually honorable, I happen to
      know that he is in trouble&mdash;ahem! ahem! pecuniary trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, while his friend of the military title looked hard at
      the grate, as if selecting a fair mark, then made a clucking noise, and
      drenched it completely. He then said, musingly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;ah yes&mdash;I see. It is a great pity. The best men
      get into such trouble. How much money did you say he wanted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said he was in pecuniary trouble,&rdquo; returned Mr. Ele, with a
      slight tone of correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, Mr. Ele,&rdquo; answered the other, a little
      pompously, and with an air of saying, &ldquo;Know your place, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, and I wish to know how large a sum would relieve Mr.
      Bodley from his immediate pressure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think about eight or nine thousand dollars. Perhaps a thousand
      more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said General Belch, slowly, still looking into
      the blank, dismal grate, and rubbing his fat nose steadily with his fat
      forefinger and thumb, &ldquo;I suppose that a man situated as Mr. Bodley
      is finds it very detrimental to his business to be engaged in public life,
      and might possibly feel it to be his duty to his family and creditors to
      resign his place, if he saw a promising way of righting his business,
      without depending upon the chances of a Congressional career.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he drew to the end of this hypothetical harangue General Belch looked
      sideways at his companion to see if he probably understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Mr. Ele shook his head in turn, looked solemnly into the
      empty grate, and said, slowly and with gravity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The supposition might be entertained for the sake of the argument.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The General was apparently satisfied with this reply, for he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us, then, suppose that a sum of eight or nine thousand dollars
      having been raised&mdash;and Mr. Bodley having resigned&mdash;that a new
      candidate is to be selected who shall&mdash;who shall, in fact, serve his
      country from our point of view, who ought the man to be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; who ought the man to be?&rdquo; replied Mr. Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen looked gravely into the grate. General Belch squirted
      reflectively. The Honorable Mr. Ele raised his hand and shaded his eyes,
      and gazed steadfastly, as if he expected to see the candidate emerge from
      the chimney. While they still sat thoughtfully a knock was heard at the
      door. The General started and brought down his chair with a crash. Mr. Ele
      turned sharply round, as if the candidate had taken him by surprise in
      coming in by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy handed General Belch a note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR BELCH,&mdash;B. Newt, Son, &amp; Co. have stopped. We do
      not hear of an assignment, so desire you to take steps at once to secure
      judgment upon the inclosed account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, PERIWING &amp; BUDDBY.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said General Belch, as the messenger retired, &ldquo;old
      Newt&rsquo;s smashed! However, it&rsquo;s a great while since he has done
      any thing for the party.&mdash;By Jove!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last exclamation was sudden, as if he had been struck by a happy
      thought. He took a fresh quid in his mouth, and, putting his hands upon
      his knees, sat silently for five minutes, and then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the man?&rdquo; said Ele, looking at him with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Look here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele did look, as earnestly as if he expected the General to take the
      man out of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we want to get the grant, at any rate. If we only have men
      who see from our point of view, we are sure of it. I think I know a man
      who can be persuaded to look at the matter from that point&mdash;a man who
      may be of very great service to the party, if we can persuade him to see
      from our point of view.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel Newt,&rdquo; replied General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele seemed somewhat surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;ah&mdash;indeed. I did not know he was in
      political life,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele looked for further instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every body must begin,&rdquo; said Belch. &ldquo;Look here. If we
      don&rsquo;t get this grant from Congress, what on earth is the use of
      having worked so long in this devilish old harness of politics? Haven&rsquo;t
      we been to primary meetings, and conventions, and elections, and all the
      other tomfoolery, speechifying and plotting and setting things right, and
      being bled, by Jupiter!&mdash;bled to the tune of more hundreds than I
      mean to lose; and now, just as we are where a bold push will save every
      thing, and make it worth while to have worked in the nasty mill so long,
      we must have our wits about us. Do you know Abel Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. He is a gentleman without the slightest squeamishness. He is
      perfectly able to see things from particular points of view. He has great
      knowledge of the world, and he is a friend of the people, Sir. His
      politics are of the right kind,&rdquo; said General Belch, in a tone which
      seemed to be setting the tune for any future remarks Mr. Ele might have to
      make about Mr. Newt&mdash;at public meetings, for instance, or elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear he is a friend of the people,&rdquo; returned Mr.
      Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir, he is the consistent enemy of a purse-proud aristocracy,
      Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; purse-proud aristocracy,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Ele, as if
      conning a lesson by rote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dandled in the lap of luxury, he does not hesitate to descend from
      it to espouse the immortal cause of popular rights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Popular rights,&rdquo; returned the Honorable Mr. Ele, studying his
      lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Animated by a glowing patriotism, he stands upon the people, and
      waves above his head the glorious flag of our country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glorious flag of our country,&rdquo; responded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The undaunted enemy of monopoly, he is equally the foe of class
      legislation and the friend of State rights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend of State rights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said General Belch, looking blankly at Mr. Ele,
      &ldquo;where was I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend of State rights,&rdquo; parroted Mr. Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; oh yes! And if ever the glorious fabric of our country&rsquo;s&mdash;our
      country&rsquo;s&mdash;our country&rsquo;s&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash; it! our
      country&rsquo;s what, Mr. Ele?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That honorable gentleman was engaged with his own thoughts while he
      followed with his tongue the words of his friend, so that, perhaps a
      little maliciously, perhaps a little unconsciously, he went on in the same
      wooden tone of repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; it! Our country&rsquo;s what, Mr. Ele?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch looked at his companion. They both smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the old phrases sort o&rsquo; slip out, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
      asked the General, squirting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do,&rdquo; said Mr. Ele, taking snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, don&rsquo;t you see what kind of man Abel Newt is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, indeed,&rdquo; replied Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, if you fellows from the city don&rsquo;t look out for
      yourselves, you&rsquo;ll find him riding upon your shoulders. He is a
      smart fellow. I am very sorry for Watkins Bodley. Any family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a good deal,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ele, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah indeed! Pity! pity! I suppose, then, that a proper sense of what
      he owes to his family&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without question. Oh! certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see, then, that we have any thing else that ought to
      detain you. I will see Mr. Newt, and let you know. Good-morning, Mr. Ele&mdash;good-morning,
      my dear Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the General bowed out the representative so imperatively that the
      Honorable B. Jawley Ele felt very much as if he had been kicked down
      stairs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXI. &mdash; GONE TO PROTEST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was an unnatural silence and order in the store of Boniface Newt,
      Son, &amp; Co. The long linen covers were left upon the goods. The cases
      were closed. The boys sat listlessly and wonderingly about. The porter lay
      upon a bale reading a newspaper. There was a sombre regularity and repose,
      like that of a house in which a corpse lies, upon the morning of the
      funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boniface Newt sat in his office haggard and gray. His face, like his
      daughter Fanny&rsquo;s, had grown sharp, and almost fierce. The blinds
      were closed, and the room was darkened. His port-folio lay before him upon
      the desk, open. The paper was smooth and white, and the newly-mended pens
      lay carefully by the inkstand. But the merchant did not write. He had not
      written that day. His white, bony hand rested upon the port-folio, and the
      long fingers drummed upon it at intervals, while his eyes half-vacantly
      wandered out into the store and saw the long shrouds drawn over the goods.
      Occasionally a slight sigh of weariness escaped him. But he did not seem
      to care to distract his mind from its gloomy intentness; for the morning
      paper lay beside him unopened, although it was afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the outer office the book-keeper was still at work. He looked from book
      to book, holding the leaves and letting them fall carefully&mdash;comparing,
      computing, writing in the huge volumes, and filing various papers away.
      Sometimes, while he yet held the leaves in his hands and the pen in his
      mouth, with the appearance of the utmost abstraction in his task, his eyes
      wandered in to the inner office, and dimly saw his employer sitting silent
      and listless at his desk. For many years he had been Boniface Newt&rsquo;s
      clerk; for many years he had been a still, faithful, hard-worked servant.
      He had two holidays, besides the Sundays&mdash;New Year&rsquo;s Day and
      the Fourth of July. The rest of the year he was in the office by nine in
      the morning, and did not leave before six at night. During the time he had
      been quietly writing in those great red books he had married a wife and
      seen the roses fade in her cheeks&mdash;he had had children grow-up around
      him&mdash;fill his evening home and his Sunday hours with light&mdash;marry,
      one after another, until his home had become as it was before a child was
      born to him, and then gradually grow bright and musical again with the
      eyes and voices of another generation. Glad to earn his little salary,
      which was only enough for decency of living, free from envy and ambition,
      he was bound by a kind of feudal tenure to his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked at the merchant and observed his hopeless listlessness, he
      thought of his age, his family, and of the frightful secrets hidden in the
      huge books that were every night locked carefully into the iron safe, as
      if they were written all over with beautiful romances instead of terrible
      truths&mdash;and the eyes of the patient plodder were so blurred that he
      could not see, and turning his head that no one might observe him, he
      winked until he could see again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man entered the store hastily. The porter dropped the paper and
      sprang up; the boys came expectantly forward. Even the book-keeper stopped
      to watch the new-comer as he came rapidly toward the office. Only the head
      of the house sat unconcernedly at his desk&mdash;his long, pale, bony
      fingers drumming on the port-folio&mdash;his hard eyes looking out at the
      messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said the book-keeper, suddenly, as he saw that he
      was going toward Mr. Newt&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want Mr. Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young one, Mr. Abel Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the book-keeper was aware the young man had opened the door that
      communicated with Mr. Newt&rsquo;s room. The haggard face under the gray
      hair turned slowly toward the messenger. There was something in the
      sitting figure that made the youth lift his hand and remove his cap, and
      say, in a low, respectful voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me, Sir, where to find Mr. Abel Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The long, pale, bony fingers still listlessly drummed. The hard eyes
      rested upon the questioner for a few moments; then, without any evidence
      of interest, the old man answered simply, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and looked
      away as if he had forgotten the stranger&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a note for him from General Belch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray head beckoned mechanically toward the other room, as if all
      business were to be transacted there; and the young man bowing again, with
      a vague sense of awe, went in to the outer office and handed the note to
      the book-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very short and simple, as Abel found when he read it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have just heard of your misfortunes. Don&rsquo;t
      be dismayed. In the shindy of life every body must have his head broken
      two or three times, and in our country &lsquo;tis a man&rsquo;s duty to
      fall on his feet. Such men as Abel Newt are not made to fail. I want to
      see you immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours very truly,
    </p>
    <h3>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXII. &mdash; THE CRASH, UP TOWN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The moment Mrs. Dagon heard the dismal news of Boniface Newt&rsquo;s
      failure she came running round to see his wife. The house was as solemnly
      still as the store and office down town. Mrs. Dagon looked in at the
      parlor, which was darkened by closed blinds and shades drawn over the
      windows, and in which all the furniture was set as for a funeral, except
      that the chilly chintz covers were not removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Mrs. Nancy Newt in her chamber with May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! What does this mean? It&rsquo;s all nothing. Don&rsquo;t
      you be alarmed. What&rsquo;s failing? It doesn&rsquo;t mean any thing; and
      I really hope, now that he has actually failed and done with it, Boniface
      will be a little more cheerful and liberal. Those parlor curtains are
      positively too bad! Boniface ought to have plenty of time to himself; and
      I hope he will give more of those little dinners, and cheer himself up!
      How is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt was dissolved in tears. She shook her head weakly, and rubbed
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Aunt Dagon, it&rsquo;s dreadful to see him. He don&rsquo;t seem
      himself. He does nothing but sit at the table and drum with his fingers;
      and in the night he lies awake, thinking. And, oh dear!&rdquo; she said,
      giving way to a sudden burst of grief, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t scold at
      any thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon listened and reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;has he settled any thing upon
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Dagon,&rdquo; said May, who sat by, looking at the old lady,
      &ldquo;we are now poor people. We shall sell this house, and go and live
      in a small way out of sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddle, diddle! my dear,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Dagon, warmly;
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll do no such thing. Poor people, indeed! Why, May, you
      know nothing about these things. Failing, failing; why, my dear, that&rsquo;s
      nothing. A New York merchant expects to fail, just as an English lord
      expects to have the gout. It isn&rsquo;t exactly a pleasant thing, but it&rsquo;s
      extremely respectable. Every body fails. It&rsquo;s understood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s understood?&rdquo; asked May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that business is a kind of game, and that every body runs for
      luck. Oh, I know all about it, my dear! It&rsquo;s all a string of cards&mdash;as
      Colonel Burr used to say; and I think if any body knew the world he did&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      all a string of blocks. B trusts A, C trusts B, D trusts C, and so on. A
      tumbles over, and down go B, and C, and D. That&rsquo;s the whole of it,
      my dear. Colonel Burr used to say that his rule was to keep himself just
      out of reach of any other block. If they knock me over, my dear Miss
      Bunley, he once said to me&mdash;ah! May, what a voice he said it in, what
      an eye!&mdash;if they knock me over, I shall be so busy picking myself up
      that I shall be forced to be selfish, and can&rsquo;t help them, so I had
      better keep away, and then I can be of some service. That was Colonel Burr&rsquo;s
      principle. He declared it was the only way in which you could be sure of
      helping others. People talk about Colonel Burr. My dear, Colonel Burr was
      a man who minded his own business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May Newt held her tongue. She felt instinctively that a woman of
      sixty-five, who had been trained by Colonel Burr, was not very likely to
      accept the opinions of a girl of her years. Mrs. Newt was feebly rocking
      herself during the conversation between her daughter and aunt; and when
      they had finished said, despairingly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! what will people say? Oh! I can&rsquo;t go and live poor.
      I&rsquo;m not used to it. I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live poor!&rdquo; sniffed Mrs. Dagon; &ldquo;of course you won&rsquo;t
      live poor. I&rsquo;ve heard Boniface say often enough that it was too bad,
      but it was a world of good-for-nothing people; and you don&rsquo;t think
      he&rsquo;s going to let good-for-nothing people drive him from a becoming
      style of living? Fiddle! I&rsquo;d like to see him undertake to live poor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think people will come to see us?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come? Of course they will. They&rsquo;ll all rush, the first thing,
      to see how you take it. Why, such a thing as this is a godsend to &lsquo;em.
      They&rsquo;ll have something to talk about for a week. And they&rsquo;ll
      all try to discover if you mean to sell out at auction. Oh, they will be
      <i>so</i> sorry!&rdquo; said the old lady, imitating imaginary callers;
      &ldquo;&lsquo;and, my dear Mrs. Newt, what <i>are</i> you going to do? And
      to think of your being obliged to leave this lovely house!&rsquo; Come?&mdash;did
      you ever know the vultures not to come to a carcass?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nancy Newt looked appalled; and so energetic was Mrs. Dagon in her
      allusion to vultures and carcass, that her niece unconsciously put to her
      nose the smelling-bottle she held in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s dreadful!&rdquo; she sighed, rocking and smelling,
      and with the tears oozing from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddle! I won&rsquo;t hear of it. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t dreadful. It&rsquo;s
      nothing at all. You must go out with me and make calls this very morning.
      It&rsquo;s none of your business. If your husband chooses to fail, let him
      fail. He can&rsquo;t expect you to take to making shirts, and to give up
      society. I shall call at twelve in the carriage; and, mind, don&rsquo;t
      you look red and mopy. Remember. So, good-morning! And, May, I want to
      speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They left Mrs. Newt rocking and weeping, with the smelling-bottle at her
      nose, and descended to the solemn parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought this about?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dagon, as she closed the
      door. &ldquo;Your mother is in such a state that it does no good to talk
      to her. Where&rsquo;s Abel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Dagon, I have my own opinion, but I know nothing. I suppose
      Abel is down town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May paused for a moment, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I have heard drop from father during the last few years
      since Abel has been in the business, I don&rsquo;t believe that Abel has
      helped him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Dagon, as if soliloquizing;
      &ldquo;and why on earth didn&rsquo;t the fellow marry Hope Wayne, or that
      Southern girl, Grace Plumer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel marry Hope Wayne?&rdquo; asked May, with an air and tone of
      such utter amazement and incredulity that Aunt Dagon immediately recovered
      from her abstraction, and half smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why not?&rdquo; said she, with equal simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Newt knew Hope Wayne personally, and she had also heard of her from
      Gabriel Bennet. Indeed, Gabriel had no secrets from May. The whole school
      story of his love had been told to her, and she shared the young man&rsquo;s
      feeling for the woman who, as a girl, had so utterly enthralled his
      imagination. But Gabriel&rsquo;s story of school life also included her
      brother Abel, and what she heard of the boy agreed with what she knew and
      felt of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; said May Newt, loftily, &ldquo;that Hope Wayne
      would be as likely to marry Aaron Burr as Abel Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon looked at her kindly, and with amused admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, May, at any rate I congratulate Gabriel Bennet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May&rsquo;s lofty look drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if&rdquo;&mdash;continued Mrs. Dagon&mdash;&ldquo;if it was so
      wonderfully impossible that Abel should marry Hope Wayne, why might he not
      have married Grace Plumer, or some other rich girl? I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
      care who. It was evidently the only thing for <i>him</i>, whatever it may
      be for other people. When you are of my age, May, you will rate things
      differently. Well-bred men and women in society ought to be able to marry
      any body. Society isn&rsquo;t heaven, and it&rsquo;s silly to behave as if
      it were. Your romance is very pretty, dear; we all have it when we are
      young, as we have the measles and the whooping-cough. But we get robust
      constitutions, my dear,&rdquo; said the old lady, smiling kindly, &ldquo;when
      we have been through all that business. When you and Gabriel have half a
      dozen children, and your girls grow up to be married, you&rsquo;ll
      understand all about it. I suppose you know about Mellish Whitloe and
      Laura Magot, don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May shook her head negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they are people who were wise early. Just after they were
      married he said to her, &lsquo;Laura, I see that you are fond of this new
      dance which is coming in; you like to waltz.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo;
      said she. &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like it, and I don&rsquo;t want you
      to waltz.&rsquo; She pouted and cried, and called him a tyrant. He hummed
      Yankee Doodle. &lsquo;I <i>will</i> waltz,&rsquo; said she at length.
      &lsquo;Very well, my dear,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make a
      bargain with you. If you waltz, I&rsquo;ll get drunk.&rsquo; You see it
      works perfectly. They respect each other, and each does as the other
      wishes. I hope you&rsquo;ll be as wise with Gabriel, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt, I hope I shall never be as old as you are,&rdquo; said May,
      quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dagon laughed her laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, dear, stand by
      your colors. You&rsquo;re all safe. Gabriel is Lawrence&rsquo;s partner.
      You can afford to be romantic, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke the door opened, and Abel entered. His dress was disordered,
      his face was flushed, and his manner excited. He ran up to May and kissed
      her. She recoiled from the unaccustomed caress, and both she and Mrs.
      Dagon perceived in his appearance and manner, as well as in the odor which
      presently filled the room, that Abel was intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May, darling,&rdquo; he began in a maudlin tone, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s
      our dear mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty well,&rdquo; replied May, &ldquo;but you had
      better not go up and see her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling, I won&rsquo;t go if you say not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes then fell uncertainly upon Mrs. Dagon, and he added, thickly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only Aunt Dagon. How do, Aunt Dagon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her and at May, and continued,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind Aunt Dagon. Do you mind her, May?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, Abel?&rdquo; asked May, with the old expression
      sliding into her eyes that used to be there when she sat alone&mdash;a
      fairy princess in her tower, and thought of many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel had seated himself upon the sofa, with his hat still on his head.
      There was perhaps something in May&rsquo;s tone that alarmed him, for he
      began to shed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! May, don&rsquo;t you love your poor Abel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him without speaking. At length she said, &ldquo;Where have
      you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to General Belch&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he sobbed, in
      reply; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t mind Aunt Dagon, if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that, you silly fool?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dagon,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel stopped and looked half angry, for a moment, but immediately fell
      into the old strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I&rsquo;d just as lieve say it before her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then say it,&rdquo; said May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, May, darling, couldn&rsquo;t you now just coax Gabriel&mdash;good
      fellow, Gabriel&mdash;used to know him and love him at school&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      you coax him to get Uncle Lawrence to do something?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      May shook her head. Abel began to snivel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean for the house. D&mdash;&mdash;n it, that&rsquo;s
      gone to smash. I mean for myself. May, for your poor brother Abel. You
      might just try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay back and looked at her ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Dagon,&rdquo; she said, quietly, &ldquo;we had better go out
      of the room. Abel, don&rsquo;t you come up stairs while you are in this
      state. I know all that Uncle Lawrence has done for father and you, and he
      will do nothing more. Do you expect him to pay your gambling debts?&rdquo;
      she asked, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel raised himself fiercely, while the bad blackness filled his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;d old hunks!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nobody heard. Mrs. Dagon and May Newt had closed the door, and Abel
      was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said, moodily and aloud, but still
      thickly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I shall have to do just as Belch
      wishes. But he must help me. If he expects me to serve him, he must serve
      me. He says he can&mdash;buy off&mdash;Bodley&mdash;and then&mdash;why,
      then&mdash;devil take it!&rdquo; he said, vacantly, with heavy eyes,
      &ldquo;then&mdash;then&mdash;oh yes!&rdquo; He smiled a maudlin smile.
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I shall be a great&mdash;a great&mdash;great&mdash;man&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      be&mdash;rep&mdash;rep&mdash;sentive&mdash;ofs&mdash;ofs&mdash;dear pe&mdash;pe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His head fell like a lump upon the cushion of the sofa, and he breathed
      heavily, until the solemn, dark, formal parlor smelled like a bar-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIII. &mdash; ENDYMION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt had told Aunt Martha that he preferred to hear from a young
      woman&rsquo;s own lips that she loved him. Was he suspicious of the truth
      of Aunt Martha&rsquo;s assertion?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Burt will was read, and Fanny Dinks had hissed her envy and
      chagrin, she had done more than she would willingly have done: she had
      said that all the world knew he was in love with Hope Wayne. If all the
      world knew it, then surely Amy Waring did; &ldquo;and if she did, was it
      so strange,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that she should have said what she
      did to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought often of these things. But one of the days when he sat in his
      office, and the junior partner was engaged in writing the letters which
      formerly Lawrence wrote, the question slid into his mind as brightly, but
      as softly and benignantly, as daylight into the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it follow that she does not love me? If she did love me, but
      thought that I loved Hope Wayne, would she not hide it from me in every
      way&mdash;not only to save her own pride, but in order not to give me
      pain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So secret and reticent was he, that as he thought this he was nervously
      anxious lest the junior partner should happen to look up and read it all
      in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt rose and stood at the window, with his back to Gabriel, for
      his thoughts grew many and strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came down that morning he had stopped at Hope Wayne&rsquo;s, and
      they had talked for a long time. Gabriel had told his partner of his visit
      to Mrs. Fanny Dinks, and Lawrence had mentioned it to Hope Wayne. The
      young woman listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I ought to increase the allowance?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Alfred&rsquo;s father
      still allows him the six hundred, and Alfred has promised solemnly that he
      will never mention to his wife the thousand you allow him. I don&rsquo;t
      think he will, because he is afraid she would stop it in some way. As it
      is, she knows nothing more than that six hundred dollars seems to go a
      very great way. Your income is large; but I think a thousand dollars for
      the support of two utterly useless people is quite as much as you are
      called upon to pay, although one of them is your cousin, and the other my
      niece.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on to talk of many things. In all she showed the same calm
      candor and tenderness. In all he showed the same humorous quaintness and
      good sense. Lawrence Newt observed that these interviews were becoming
      longer and longer, although the affairs to arrange really became fewer. He
      could not discover that there was any particular reason for it; and yet he
      became uncomfortable in the degree that he was conscious of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Round Table met, it was evident from the conversation between
      Hope Wayne and Lawrence Newt that he was very often at her house; and
      sometimes, whenever they all appeared to be conscious that each one was
      thinking of that fact, the cloud of constraint settled more heavily, but
      just as impalpably as before, over the little circle. It was not removed
      by the conviction which Amy Waring and Arthur Merlin entertained, that at
      all such times Hope Wayne was trying not to show that she was peculiarly
      excited by this consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was excited by it. She knew that the interviews were longer and
      longer, and that there was less reason than ever for any interviews
      whatsoever. But when Lawrence Newt was talking to her&mdash;when he was
      looking at her&mdash;when he was moving about the room&mdash;she was
      happier than she had ever been&mdash;happier than she had supposed she
      could ever be. When he went, that day was done. Nor did another dawn until
      he came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Hope Wayne understood the meaning of that mysterious constraint
      which now so often enveloped the Round Table.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Arthur Merlin, the poor fellow did what all poor fellows do. So
      long as it was uncertain whether she loved him or not, he was willing to
      say nothing. But when he was perfectly sure that there was no hope for
      him, he resolved to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain his Aunt Winnifred had tried to cheer him. Ever since the morning
      when he had told her in his studio the lovely legend of Latmos he could
      not persuade himself that he had not unwittingly told his own story. Aunt
      Winnifred showered the choicest tracts about his room. She said with a
      sigh that she was sure he had experienced no change of heart; and Arthur
      replied, with a melancholy smile, &ldquo;Not the slightest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind old lady was sorely puzzled. It did not occur to her that her
      Arthur could be the victim of an unfortunate attachment, like the
      love-lorn heroes of whom she had read in the evil days when she read
      novels. It did not occur to her, because she could as easily have supposed
      a rose-tree to resist June as any woman her splendid Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      If some gossip to whom she sighed and shook her head, and wondered what
      could possibly ail Arthur&mdash;who still ate his dinner heartily, and had
      as many orders for portraits as he cared to fulfill&mdash;suggested that
      there was a woman in the case, good Aunt Winnifred smiled bland
      incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Toxer, I should like to see that woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she plied her knitting-needles nimbly, sighed, scratched her head
      with a needle, counted her stitches, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I can&rsquo;t but hope that it is concern of mind,
      without his knowing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Toxer also knitted, and scratched, and counted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; much more likely concern of heart with a full
      consciousness of it. One, two, three&mdash;bless my soul! I&rsquo;m always
      dropping a stitch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Winnifred, who never dropped stitches, smiled pleasantly, and
      answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, and this time you have dropped a very great one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Arthur&rsquo;s great picture advanced rapidly. Diana, who had
      looked only like a portrait of Hope Wayne looking out of a cloud, was now
      more fully completed. She was still bending from the clouds indeed, but
      there was more and more human softness in the face every time he touched
      it. And lo! he had found at last Endymion. He lay upon a grassy knoll.
      Long whispering tufts sighed around his head, which rested upon the very
      summit of the mountain. There were no trees, no rocks. There was nothing
      but the sleeping figure with the shepherd&rsquo;s crook by his side upon
      the mountain top, all lying bare to the sky and to the eyes that looked
      from the cloud, and from which all the moonlight of the picture fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lawrence Newt came into the studio one morning, Arthur, who worked in
      secret upon his picture and never showed it, asked him if he would like to
      look at it. The merchant said yes, and seated himself comfortably in a
      large chair, while the artist brought the canvas from an inner room and
      placed it before him. As he did so, Arthur stepped a little aside, and
      watched him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt gazed for a long time and silently at the picture. As he did
      so, his face rapidly donned its armor of inscrutability, and Arthur&rsquo;s
      eyes attacked it in vain. Diana was clearly Hope Wayne. That he had seen
      from the beginning. But Endymion was as clearly Lawrence Newt! He looked
      steadily without turning his eyes, and after many minutes he said,
      quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beautiful. It is triumphant. Endymion is a trifle too old,
      perhaps. But Diana&rsquo;s face is so noble, and her glance so tenderly
      earnest, that it would surely rouse him if he were not dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; returned Arthur; &ldquo;why you know he is only
      sleeping.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lawrence, gently, &ldquo;dead; utterly dead&mdash;to
      her. If he were not, it would be simply impossible not to awake and love
      her. Who&rsquo;s that old gentleman on the wall over there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt asked the same question of all the portraits so persistently
      that Arthur could not return to his Diana. When he had satisfied his
      curiosity&mdash;a curiosity which he had never shown before&mdash;the
      merchant rose and said good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt turned, with his hand upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like my picture&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immensely. But if she looks forever she&rsquo;ll never waken him.
      Poor Endymion! he&rsquo;s dead to all that heavenly splendor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about closing the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt put his head into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fortunate that he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; said the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because goddesses never marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s head disappeared.

      CHAPTER LXIV. &mdash; DIANA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Miss Hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Merlin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and seated himself, and the conversation seemed to have
      terminated. Hope Wayne was embroidering. The moment she perceived that
      there was silence she found it very hard to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you busy now?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very busy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as men and women are vain, so long your profession will
      flourish, I suppose,&rdquo; she replied, lifting her eyes and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it because it tells the truth,&rdquo; replied Arthur,
      crushing his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It omitted Alexander&rsquo;s wry neck,&rdquo; said Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It put in Cromwell&rsquo;s pimple,&rdquo; answered Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, that is not the kind of truth I mean&mdash;I mean poetic
      truth. Michael Angelo&rsquo;s Last Judgment shows the whole Catholic
      Church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne felt relieved, and looked interested. She did not feel so much
      afraid of the silence, now that Arthur seemed entering upon a
      disquisition. But he stopped and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve painted a picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full of poetic truth, I suppose,&rdquo; rejoined Hope, still
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask you to go and see that for yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid aside her embroidery, and in a little while they had reached his
      studio. As Hope Wayne entered she was impressed by the spaciousness of the
      room, the chastened light, and the coruscations of rich color hanging upon
      the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the garden of the Hesperides,&rdquo; she said,
      gayly&mdash;&ldquo;such mellow shadows, and such gorgeous colors, like
      those of celestial fruits. I don&rsquo;t wonder you paint poetic truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you shall judge,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne seated herself in the chair where Lawrence Newt had been
      sitting not two hours before, and settled herself to enjoy the spectacle
      she anticipated; for she had a secret faith in Arthur&rsquo;s genius, and
      she meant to purchase this great work of poetic truth at her own
      valuation. Arthur placed the picture upon the easel and drew the curtain
      from it, stepping aside as before to watch her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The airy smile upon Hope Wayne&rsquo;s face faded instantly. The blood
      rushed to her hair. But she did not turn her eyes, nor say a word. The
      moment she felt she could trust her voice, she asked, gravely, without
      looking at Arthur,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Diana and Endymion,&rdquo; replied the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at it for a long time, half-closing her eyes, which clung to
      the face of Endymion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not made Diana tender enough,&rdquo; thought Arthur,
      mournfully, as he watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soundly he sleeps!&rdquo; said Hope Wayne, at length, as if she
      had been really trying to wake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he merely sleeps?&rdquo; asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I thought so too. But Lawrence Newt, who sat two hours ago just
      where you are sitting, said, as he looked at the picture, that Endymion
      was dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne put her finger to her lip, and looked inquiringly at her
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! Did he say dead?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; repeated Arthur Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Endymion only slept,&rdquo; continued Hope Wayne; &ldquo;but
      Mr. Newt is a judge of pictures&mdash;he knows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly spoke as if he knew,&rdquo; persisted the painter,
      recklessly, as he saw and felt the usual calmness return to his companion.
      &ldquo;He said that if Endymion were not dead he couldn&rsquo;t resist
      such splendor of beauty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Arthur Merlin spoke he looked directly into Hope Wayne&rsquo;s face, as
      if he were speaking of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt&rsquo;s judgment seems to be better than his memory,&rdquo;
      said she, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He forgets that Endymion <i>did</i> awake. He has not allowed time
      enough for the effect of Diana&rsquo;s eyes. Now I am sure,&rdquo; she
      said, shaking her finger at the picture, &ldquo;I am sure that that silly
      shepherd will not sleep there forever. Never fear, he will wake up. Diana
      never looks or loves for nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do no good if he does,&rdquo; insisted Arthur, ruefully, as
      if he were sure that Hope Wayne understood that he was speaking in
      parables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, as she rose, still looking at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because goddesses never marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked into her eyes with so much meaning, and the &ldquo;do they?&rdquo;
      which he did not utter, was so perfectly expressed by his tone, that Hope
      Wayne, as she moved slowly toward the door, looking at the pictures on the
      wall as she passed, said, with her eyes upon the pictures, and not upon
      the painter,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the moral of that remark of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moral? Heaven forbid! I don&rsquo;t make moral remarks,&rdquo;
      replied Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time you have done it,&rdquo; she said, smiling; &ldquo;you
      have made a remark with a moral. I&rsquo;m going, and I leave it with you
      as a legacy. The moral is, If goddesses never marry, don&rsquo;t fall in
      love with a goddess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hand to him as she spoke. He involuntarily took it, and
      they shook hands warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Merlin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Remember the
      Round Table to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gone, and Arthur Merlin sank into the chair she had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Heavens!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did she understand or not?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXV. &mdash; THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      General Belch&rsquo;s office was in the lower part of Nassau Street. At
      the outer door there was a modest slip of a tin sign, &ldquo;Arcularius
      Belch, Attorney and Counselor.&rdquo; The room itself was dingy and
      forlorn. There was no carpet on the floor; the windows were very dirty,
      and slats were broken out of the blinds&mdash;the chairs did not match&mdash;there
      was a wooden book-case, with a few fat law-books lounging upon the
      shelves; the table was a chaos of pamphlets, printed forms, newspapers,
      and files of letters, with a huge inkstand, inky pens, and a great wooden
      sand-box. Upon each side of the chimney, the grate in which was piled with
      crushed pieces of waste paper, and the bars of which were discolored with
      tobacco juice, stood two large spittoons, the only unsoiled articles in
      the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the place in which General Belch did business. It had the
      atmosphere of Law. But, above all, it was the spot where, with one leg
      swinging over the edge of the table and one hand waving in earnest
      gesticulation, General Belch could say to every body who came, and
      especially to his poorer fellow-citizens, &ldquo;I ask no office; I am
      content with my moderate practice. It is enough for me, in this glorious
      country, to be a friend of the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this&mdash;or only implied it in saying something else&mdash;the
      broken slats, the dirty windows, the uncarpeted floor, the universal
      untidiness, whispered in the mind of the hearer, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His residence, however, somewhat atoned for the discomfort of his office.
      Not unfrequently he entertained his friends sumptuously; and whenever any
      of the representatives of his party, who acted in Congress as his private
      agents, had succeeded&mdash;as on one occasion, already commemorated, the
      Hon. Mr. Ele had&mdash;in putting a finer edge upon a favorite axe,
      General Belch entertained a select circle who agreed with him in his
      political philosophy, and were particular friends of the people and of the
      popular institutions of their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt, in response to the General&rsquo;s note, had already called at
      that gentleman&rsquo;s office, and had received overtures from him, who
      offered him Mr. Bodley&rsquo;s seat in Congress, upon condition that he
      was able to see things from particular points of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Watkins Bodley, it seems,&rdquo; said General Belch, &ldquo;and
      I regret to say it, is in straitened pecuniary circumstances. I understand
      he will feel that he owes it to his family to resign before the next
      session. There will be a vacancy; and I am glad to say that the party is
      just now in a happy state of harmony, and that my influence will secure
      your nomination. But come up to-night and talk it over. I have asked Ele
      and Slugby, and a few others&mdash;friends of course&mdash;and I hope Mr.
      Bat will drop in. You know Aquila Bat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By reputation,&rdquo; replied Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very quiet man, but very shrewd. He gives great dignity and
      weight to the party. A tremendous lawyer Bat is. I suppose he is at the
      very head of the profession in this country. You&rsquo;ll come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel was most happy to accept. He was happy to go any where for
      distraction. For the rooms in Grand Street had become inconceivably
      gloomy. There were no more little parties there: the last one was given in
      honor of Mrs. Sligo Moultrie&mdash;before her marriage. The elegant youth
      of the town gradually fell off from frequenting Abel&rsquo;s rooms, for he
      always proposed cards, and the stakes were enormous; which was a
      depressing circumstance to young gentlemen who mainly depended upon the
      paternal purse. Such young gentlemen as Zephyr Wetherley, who was for a
      long time devoted to young Mrs. Mellish Whitloe, and sent her the
      loveliest fans, and buttons, and little trinkets, which he selected at
      Marquand&rsquo;s. But when the year came round the bill was inclosed to
      Mr. Wetherley, senior, who, after a short and warm interview with his son
      Zephyr, inclosed it in turn to Whitloe himself; who smiled, and paid it,
      and advised his wife to buy her own jewelry in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not pleasant for young Wetherley, and his friends in a similar
      situation, to sit down to a night at cards with such a desperate player as
      Abel Newt. Besides, his rooms had lost that air of voluptuous elegance
      which was formerly so unique. The furniture was worn out, and not
      replaced. The decanters and bottles were no longer kept in a pretty
      side-board, but stood boldly out, ready for instant service; and whenever
      one of the old set of men happened in, he was very likely to find a
      gentleman&mdash;whose toilet was suspiciously fine, whose gold looked like
      gilt&mdash;who made himself entirely at home with Abel and his rooms, and
      whose conversation indicated that his familiar haunts were race-courses,
      bar-rooms, and gambling-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unanimously decreed that Abel Newt had lost tone. His dress was
      gradually becoming flashy. Younger sisters, who had heard their elders&mdash;who
      were married now&mdash;speak of the fascinating Mr. Newt, perceived that
      the fascinating Mr. Newt was a little too familiar when he flirted, and
      that his breath was offensive with spirituous fumes. He was noisy in the
      gentlemen&rsquo;s dressing-room. The stories he told there were of such a
      character, and he told them so loudly, that more than once some husband,
      whose wife was in the neighboring room, had remonstrated with him. Sligo
      Moultrie, during one of the winters that he passed in the city after his
      marriage, had a fierce quarrel with Abel for that very reason. They would
      have come to blows but that their friends parted them. Mr. Moultrie sent a
      friend with a note the following morning, and Mr. Newt acknowledged that
      he had been rude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, at General Belch&rsquo;s, Abel was presented to all the
      guests. Mr. Ele was happy to remember a previous occasion upon which he
      had had the honor, etc. Mr. Enos Slugby (Chairman of our Ward Committee,
      whispered Belch, audibly, as he introduced him) was very glad to know a
      gentleman who bore so distinguished a name. Every body had a little
      compliment, to which Abel bowed and smiled politely, while he observed
      that the residence was much more comfortable than the office of General
      Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the dining-room and sat down to what Mr. Slugby called
      &ldquo;a Champagne supper.&rdquo; They ate birds and oysters, and drank
      wine. Then they ate jellies, blanc mange, and ice-cream. Then they ate
      nuts and fruit, and drank coffee. Then every thing was removed, and fresh
      decanters, fresh glasses, and a box of cigars were placed upon the table,
      and the servants were told that they need not come until summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point a dry, grave, thin, little old man opened the door. General
      Belch rose and rushed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bat, I am very happy. Sit here, Sir. Gentlemen, you all
      know Mr. Bat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The company was silent for a moment, and bowed. Abel looked up and saw a
      man who seemed to be made of parchment, and his complexion, of the hue of
      dried apples, suggested that he was usually kept in a warm green satchel.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little more murmuring of talk around the table, General Belch
      said, in a louder voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, we have a new friend among us, and a little business to
      settle to-night. Suppose we talk it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general filling of glasses and a hum of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learn,&rdquo; said the General, whiffing the smoke from his
      mouth, &ldquo;that our worthy friend and able representative, Watkins
      Bodley, is about resigning, in consequence of private embarrassments. Of
      course he must have a successor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every body poured out smoke and looked at the speaker, except Mr. Bat, who
      seemed to be undergoing a little more drying up, and looked at a picture
      of General Jackson, which hung upon the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That successor, I need not say, of course,&rdquo; continued General
      Belch, &ldquo;must be a good man and a faithful adherent of the party. He
      must be the consistent enemy of a purse-proud aristocracy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Enos Slugby, whisking a little of
      the ash from his cigar off an embroidered shirt-bosom, in doing which the
      flash from a diamond ring upon his finger dazzled Abel, who had turned as
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must espouse the immortal cause of popular rights, and be
      willing to spend and be spent for the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Mr. William Condor, whose sinecure
      under government was not worth less than twenty thousand a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must always uphold the honor of the glorious flag of our
      country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, General Belch, but I can not control my feelings; I must
      propose three cheers,&rdquo; interrupted Alderman MacDennis O&rsquo;Rourke;
      and the three cheers were heartily given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this candidate must be equally the foe of class legislation and
      the friend of State rights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Bat moved his head, as if he were assenting to a remark of his
      friend General Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I surely need not add that it would be the first and most
      sacred point of honor with this candidate to serve his party in every
      thing, to be the unswerving advocate of all its measures, and implicitly
      obedient to all its behests,&rdquo; said General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which behests are to be learned by him from the authorized leaders
      of the party,&rdquo; said Mr. Enos Slugby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said half of the gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the other half.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the remarks that General Belch had been making his eyes were fixed
      upon Abel Newt, who understood that this was a political examination, in
      which the questions asked included the answers that were to be given. When
      the General had ended, the company sat intently smoking for some time, and
      filling and emptying their glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bat,&rdquo; said General Belch, &ldquo;what is your view?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bat removed his eyes from General Jackson&rsquo;s portrait, and
      cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, closing his eyes, and rubbing his fingers
      along his eyebrows, &ldquo;that the party holding to the only
      constitutional policy is to be supported at all hazards, and I think the
      great party to which we belong is that party. Our principles are all true,
      and our measures are all just. Speculative persons and dreamers talk about
      independent political action. But politics always beget parties.
      Governments are always managed by parties, and parties are always managed
      by&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dried-apple complexion at this point assumed an ashy hue, as if
      something very indiscreet had been almost uttered. Mr. Bat&rsquo;s eyes
      opened and saw Abel&rsquo;s fixed upon him with a peculiar intelligence.
      The whole party looked a little alarmed at Mr. Bat, and apprehensively at
      the new-comer. Mr. Ele frowned at General Belch,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abel relieved the embarrassment by quietly completing Mr. Bat&rsquo;s
      sentence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;by the managers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His black eyes glittered around the table, and Mr. Ele remembered a remark
      of General Belch&rsquo;s about Mr. Newt&rsquo;s riding upon the shoulders
      of his fellow-laborers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, by the managers,&rdquo; said every body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said General Belch, cheerfully, &ldquo;whom had we
      better propose to our fellow-citizens as a proper candidate for their
      suffrages to succeed the Honorable Mr. Bodley?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back and puffed. Mr. Ele, who had had a little previous
      conversation with the host, here rose and said, that, if he might venture,
      he would say, although it was an entirely unpremeditated thing, which had,
      in fact, only struck him while he had been sitting at that hospitable
      board, but had impressed him so forcibly that he could not resist speaking&mdash;if
      he might venture, he would say that he knew a most able and highly
      accomplished gentleman&mdash;in fact, it had occurred to him that there
      was then present a gentleman who would be precisely the man whom they
      might present to the people as a candidate suitable in every way.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch looked at Abel, and said, &ldquo;Mr. Ele, whom do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refer to Mr. Abel Newt,&rdquo; responded the Honorable Mr. Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company looked as companies which have been prepared for a surprise
      always look when the surprise comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Newt sound in the faith?&rdquo; asked Mr. William Condor,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answer for him,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance, Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said Mr. Enos Slugby, who was
      interested in General Belch&rsquo;s little plans, &ldquo;you have no doubt
      that Congress ought to pass the grant to purchase the land for Fort
      Arnold, which has been offered to it by the company of which our friend
      General Belch is counsel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; replied Abel. &ldquo;I should work for it as
      hard as I could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not unnatural, because General Belch had promised him an interest
      in the sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, then,&rdquo; said Mr. William Condor, who was also a
      proprietor, &ldquo;I do not see that a better candidate could possibly be
      offered to our fellow-citizens. The General Committee meet to-morrow
      night. They will call the primaries, and the Convention will meet next
      week. I think we all understand each other. We know the best men in our
      districts to go to the Convention. The thing seems to me to be very plain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said the others, smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall it be Abel Newt?&rdquo; said Mr. Condor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; answered the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose the health of the Honorable Abel Newt, whom I cordially
      welcome as a colleague,&rdquo; said Mr. Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bumpers were drained. It was past midnight, and the gentlemen rose. They
      came to Abel and shook his hand; then they swarmed into the hall and put
      on their hats and coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, Newt,&rdquo; whispered Belch, and Abel lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable B.J. Ele also lingered, as if he would like to be the last
      out of the house; for although this distinguished statesman did not care
      to do otherwise than as General Belch commanded, he was anxious to be the
      General&rsquo;s chief butler, while the remark about riding on his
      companions&rsquo; shoulders and the personal impression Abel had made upon
      him, had seriously alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was busily looking at the portrait of General Jackson, General
      Belch stepped up to him and put out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, my dear Ele! Thank you! thank you! These things will
      not be forgotten. Good-night! good-night!&rdquo; And he backed the
      Honorable B. Jawley Ele out of the room into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your coat, I think,&rdquo; said he, taking up a garment and
      helping Mr. Ele to get it on. &ldquo;Ah, you luxurious dog! you&rsquo;re a
      pretty friend of the people, with such a splendid coat as this.
      Good-night! good-night!&rdquo; he added, helping his guest toward the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Condor!&rdquo; he shouted up the street. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      Ele&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave him behind; wait for him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put him put of the door. &ldquo;There, my dear fellow, Condor&rsquo;s
      waiting for you! Good-night! Ten thousand thanks! A pretty friend of the
      people, hey? Oh, you cunning dog! Good-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch closed the door and returned to the drawing-room. Abel Newt
      was sitting with one leg over the back of the chair, and a tumbler of
      brandy before him, smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; said Abel, laughing, as the General returned, &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t treat a dog as you do that man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Representative,&rdquo; returned Belch, &ldquo;you, as a
      legislator and public man, ought to know that Order is Heaven&rsquo;s
      first law.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVI. &mdash; MENTOR AND TELEMACHUS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Drawing his chair near to Abel&rsquo;s, General Belch lighted a cigar, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s not so very hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go to Congress,&rdquo; answered Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m not elected yet, thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Arcularius Belch blew a long, slow cloud, and gazed at his
      companion with a kind of fond superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by looking so?&rdquo; asked Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Newt, I was not aware that you had such a soft spot. No,
      positively, I did not know that you had so much to learn. It is
      inconceivable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The General smiled, and smoked, and looked blandly at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not elected yet, hey?&rdquo; asked the General, with
      an amused laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I am aware of,&rdquo; said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear fellow, who on earth do you suppose does the electing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the people were the source of power,&rdquo; replied Abel,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General looked for a moment doubtfully at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! I see you&rsquo;re gumming. However, there&rsquo;s one
      thing. You know you&rsquo;ll have to speak after the election. Did you
      ever speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since school,&rdquo; replied Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know the cue. I gave it to you to-night. The next thing
      is, how strong can you come down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve failed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have. That&rsquo;s the reason the boys will expect
      you to be very liberal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; inquired Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see. There&rsquo;ll be the printing, halls, lights, ballots,
      advertisements&mdash;Well, I should say a thousand dollars, and a thousand
      more for extras. Say two thousand for the election, and a thousand for the
      committee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil! that&rsquo;s rather strong!&rdquo; replied Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said General Belch. &ldquo;Your going to
      Washington secures the grant, and the grant nets you at least three
      thousand dollars upon every share. It&rsquo;s a good thing, and very
      liberal at that price. By-the-by, don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re a
      party man of another sort. You do the dancing business, and flirting&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; cried Abel; &ldquo;milk for babes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. And you&rsquo;re going to a place that swarms with babes.
      So give &lsquo;em milk. Work the men through their wives, and mistresses,
      and daughters. It isn&rsquo;t much understood yet; but it is a great idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to Congress?&rdquo; asked Abel, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for my interest,&rdquo; answered the General.
      &ldquo;I make more by staying out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many members are there for Belch?&rdquo; continued Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General did not quite like the question, nor the tone in which it was
      asked. His fat nose glistened for a moment, while his mouth twisted into a
      smile, and he answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only for Belch as far as Belch is for them&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or as far as Belch makes them think he is,&rdquo; answered Abel,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General smiled too, for he found the game going against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of your speech,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now, Newt,
      the thing&rsquo;s in your own hands. You&rsquo;ve a future before you.
      With the drill of the party, and with your talents, you ought to do any
      thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too many rivals,&rdquo; said Abel, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, what are the odds? They can&rsquo;t do any thing
      outside the party, or without the drill. Make it their interest not to be
      ambitious, and they&rsquo;re quiet enough. Here&rsquo;s William Condor&mdash;lovely,
      lovely William. He loves the people so dearly that he does nothing for
      them at twenty thousand dollars a year. Tell him that you will secure him
      his place, and he&rsquo;s your humble servant. Of course he is. Now I am
      more familiar with the details of these things, and I&rsquo;m always at
      your service. Before you go, there will be a caucus of the friends of the
      grant, which you must attend, and make a speech.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another speech?&rdquo; said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you are now a speech-maker by profession. Now that
      you are in Congress, you will never be free from the oratorical liability.
      Wherever two or three are gathered together, and you are one of them, you&rsquo;ll
      have to return thanks, and wave the glorious flag of our country. And you&rsquo;ll
      have to begin very soon.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVII. &mdash; WIRES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      General Belch was right. Abel had to begin very soon. The committee met
      and called the meetings. The members of the committee, each in his own
      district, consulted with various people, whom they found generally at
      corner groceries. They were large, coarse-featured, hulking men, and were
      all named Jim, or Tom, or Ned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you have, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, it&rsquo;s so early in the day, that I can&rsquo;t go
      any thing stronger than brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two cocktails&mdash;stiff,&rdquo; was the word of the gentleman to
      the bar-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The companions took their glasses, and sat down behind a heavy screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, what&rsquo;s the word? I see there&rsquo;s going to be
      more meetin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jim. Bodley has resigned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the man, Mr. Slugby?&rdquo; asked Jim, as if to bring
      matters to a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Abel Newt has been mentioned,&rdquo; replied the gentleman with
      the diamond ring, which he had slipped into his waistcoat pocket before
      the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim cocked his eye at his glass, which was nearly empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! another cocktail,&rdquo; cried Mr. Slugby to the bar-tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son of old Newt that bust t&rsquo;other day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jim, as he
      began his second tumbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; he&rsquo;s all right. He understands things, and he&rsquo;s
      coming down rather strong. By-the-by, I&rsquo;ve never paid you that ten
      dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Slugby pulled out a bill of that amount and handed it to Jim, who
      received it as if he were pleased, but did not precisely recall any such
      amount as owing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the boys will be thirsty,&rdquo; said Mr. Enos Slugby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to make a man thirsty ekal to a
      &lsquo;lection,&rdquo; answered Jim, with his huge features grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fellows work well, and deserve it. Here, you needn&rsquo;t
      go out of your district, you know, and this will be enough.&rdquo; He
      handed more money to his companion. &ldquo;Have &lsquo;em up in time, and
      don&rsquo;t let them get high until after the election of delegates. It
      was thought that perhaps Mr. Musher and I had better go to the Convention.
      It&rsquo;s just possible, Jim, that some of Bodley&rsquo;s friends may
      make trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear, Mr. Slugby, we&rsquo;ll take care of that. Who do you want
      for chairman of the meeting?&rdquo; answered Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Gasserly is the best chairman. He understands things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Sir, all right,&rdquo; said Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Jim, Wednesday night, seven o&rsquo;clock. You&rsquo;ll
      want thirty men to make every thing short and sure. Gasserly, chairman;
      Musher and Slugby, delegates. And you needn&rsquo;t say any thing about
      Abel Newt, because that will all be settled in the Convention; and the
      delegates of the people will express their will there as they choose. I&rsquo;ll
      write the names of the delegates on this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slugby tore off a piece of paper from a letter in his pocket, and
      wrote the names. He handed the list, and, taking out his watch, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, I&rsquo;m engaged at eleven, and &lsquo;tis quarter
      past. Good-by, Jim, and if any thing goes wrong let me know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, Sir,&rdquo; replied Jim, and Mr. Slugby departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. William Condor had a similar interview with Tom, and Mr. Ele took a
      friendly glass with Ned. And other Mr. Slugbys, and Condors, and Eles, had
      little interviews with other red-faced, trip-hammer-fisted Jims, Toms, and
      Neds. These healths being duly drunk, the placards were posted. They were
      headed with the inspiring words &ldquo;Liberty and Equality,&rdquo; with
      cuts of symbolic temples and ships and lifted arms with hammers, and
      summoned the legal voters to assemble in primary meetings and elect
      delegates to a convention to nominate a representative. The Hon. Mr.
      Bodley&rsquo;s letter of resignation was subjoined:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;Deeply grateful for the honorable trust you
      have so long confided to me, nothing but the imperative duty of attending
      to my private affairs, seriously injured by my public occupations, would
      induce me to resign it into your hands. But while his country may demand
      much of every patriot, there is a point, which every honest man feels, at
      which he may retire. I should be deeply grieved to take this step did I
      not know how many abler representatives you can find in the ranks of that
      constituency of which any man may be proud. I leave the halls of
      legislation at a moment when our party is consolidated, when its promise
      for the future was never more brilliant, and when peace and prosperity
      seem to have taken up their permanent abode in our happy country, whose
      triumphant experiment of popular institutions makes every despot shake
      upon his throne. Gentlemen, in bidding you farewell I can only say that,
      should the torch of the political incendiary ever be applied to the
      sublime fabric of our system, and those institutions which were laid in
      our father&rsquo;s struggles and cemented with their blood, should totter
      and crumble, I, for one, will be found going down with the ship, and
      waving the glorious flag of our country above the smouldering ruins of
      that moral night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, fellow-citizens, your obliged, faithful, and humble servant,
      WATKINS BODLEY.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of the call the meetings were held. Jim, Tom, and Ned were
      early on the ground in their respective districts, with about thirty
      chosen friends. In Jim&rsquo;s district Mr. Gasserly was elected chairman,
      and Messrs. Musher and Slugby delegates to the Convention. Mr. Slugby, who
      was present when the result was announced, said that it was extremely
      inconvenient for him to go, but that he held it to be the duty of every
      man to march at the call of the party. His private affairs would
      undoubtedly suffer, but he held that every man&rsquo;s private interest
      must give way to the good of his party. He could say the same thing for
      his friend, Mr. Musher, who was not present. But he should say to Musher&mdash;Musher,
      the people want us to go, and go we must. With the most respectful
      gratitude he accepted the appointment for himself and Musher.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brisk little off-hand speech was received with great favor.
      Immediately upon its conclusion Jim moved an adjournment, which was
      unanimously carried, and Jim led the way to a neighboring corner, where he
      expended a reasonable proportion of the money which Slugby had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few evenings afterward the Convention met. Mr. Slugby was appointed
      President, and Mr. William Condor Secretary. The Honorable B.J. Ele
      presented a series of resolutions, which were eloquently advocated by
      General Arcularius Belch. At the conclusion of his speech the Honorable A.
      Bat made a speech, which the daily <i>Flag of the Country</i> the next
      morning called &ldquo;a dry disquisition about things in general,&rdquo;
      but which the <i>Evening Banner of the Union</i> declared to be &ldquo;one
      of his most statesmanlike efforts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After these speeches the Convention proceeded to the ballot, when it was
      found that nine-tenths of all the votes cast were for Abel Newt, Esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch rose, and in an enthusiastic manner moved that the
      nomination be declared unanimous. It was carried with acclamation. Mr.
      Musher proposed an adjournment, to meet at the polls. The vote was
      unanimous. Mr. Enos Slugby rose, and called for three cheers for &ldquo;the
      Honorable Abel Newt, our next talented and able representative in
      Congress.&rdquo; The Convention rose and roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Members of the Convention who wish to call upon the candidate will
      fall into line!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Condor; then leading the way, and
      followed by the members, he went down stairs into the street. A band of
      music was at hand, by some thoughtful care, and, following the beat of
      drums and clangor of brass, the Convention marched toward Grand Street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVIII. &mdash; THE INDUSTRIOUS APPRENTICE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Good news fly fast. On the wings of the newspapers the nomination of Abel
      Newt reached Delafield, where Mr. Savory Gray still moulded the youthful
      mind. He and his boys sat at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish! fish! I like fish,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you like fish, Farthingale?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Farthingale was a new boy, who blushed, and said, promptly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like fish, Mark Blanding? Your brother Gyles used
      to,&rdquo; asked Mr. Gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; replied that youth, slowly, and with a certain
      expression in his eye, &ldquo;I suppose I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All boys who are in favor of having fish dinner on Fridays will
      hold up their right hands,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray. He looked eagerly round
      the table. &ldquo;Come, come! up, up, up!&rdquo; said he, good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Mrs. Gray, fish on Fridays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said Mark Blanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mark?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t fish cheaper than meat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark, I am ashamed of you. Go to bed this instant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark was unjust, for Uncle Savory had no thought of indulging his purse,
      but only his palate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the criminal was gone Mr. Gray drew a paper from his pocket, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, attend! In this paper, which is a New York paper, there is an
      account of the nomination of a member of Congress&mdash;a member of
      Congress, boys,&rdquo; he repeated, slowly, dwelling upon the words to
      impress their due importance. &ldquo;What do you think his name is? Who do
      you suppose it is who is nominated for Congress?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a moment, but the boys, not having the least idea, were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is Abel Newt, who used to sit at this very table. Abel
      Newt, one of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited another moment, to allow the overwhelming announcement to have
      its due effect, while the scholars all looked at him, holding their knives
      and forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is not one of you, who, if he be a good boy, may not
      arrive at the same eminence. Think, boys, any one of you, if you are good,
      may one day get nominated to Congress, as the Honorable Mr. Newt is, who
      was once a scholar here, just like you. Hurrah for Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys!
      Now eat your dinners.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIX. &mdash; IN AND OUT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Boniface Newt has failed,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet to his wife,
      in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shading his eyes with his hand, and his wife was peacefully sewing
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, but her face became serious, then changed to an
      expression in which, from under his hands, for her husband&rsquo;s eyes
      were not weak, her husband saw the faintest glimmering of triumph. But
      Mrs. Bennet did not raise her eyes from her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucia!&rdquo; He spoke so earnestly that his wife involuntarily
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she replied, looking at him with a tear in her eye,
      &ldquo;it is only natural.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband said nothing, but shook his slippered foot, and his neck sunk
      a little lower in his limp, white cravat. They were alone in the little
      parlor, with only the portrait on the wall for company, and only the roses
      in the glass upon the table, that were never wanting, and always showed a
      certain elegance of taste in arrangement and care which made the daughter
      of the house seem to be present though she might be away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful night!&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet at last, as his eyes
      lingered upon the window through which he saw the soft illumination of the
      full moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife looked for a moment with him, and answered, &ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely those roses are, and how sweet they smell!&rdquo; he
      said, after another interval of silence, and as if there were a change in
      the pleasant dreams he was dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, and looked at him and smiled, and,
      smiling, sewed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Ellen to-night?&rdquo; he asked, after a little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is walking in this beautiful moonlight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone?&rdquo; he inquired, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! with Edward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! with Edward.&rdquo; And there was evidently another turn in the
      pleasant dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gabriel&mdash;where is Gabriel?&rdquo; asked he, still shaking
      the slippered foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife smoothed her work, and said, with an air of tranquil happiness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he is walking too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, with May.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily, as she said it, she laid her work in her lap, as if her
      mind would follow undisturbed the happy figures of her children. She
      looked abstractedly at the window, as if she saw them both, the manly
      candor of her Gabriel, and the calm sweetness of May Newt&mdash;the loyal
      heart of her blue-eyed Ellen clinging to Edward Wynne. Down the windings
      of her reverie they went, roses in their cheeks and faith in their hearts.
      Down and down, farther and farther, closer and closer, while the springing
      step grew staid, and the rose bloom slowly faded. Farther and farther down
      her dream, and gray glistened in the brown hair and the black and gold,
      but the roses bloomed around them in younger cheeks, and the brown hair
      and the black and gold were as glossy and abundant upon those younger
      heads, and still their arms were twined and their eyes were linked, as if
      their hearts had grown together, each pair into one. Farther and farther&mdash;still
      with clustering younger faces&mdash;still with ever softer light in the
      air falling upon the older forms, grown reverend, until&mdash;until&mdash;had
      they faded in that light, or was she only blinded by her tears?
    </p>
    <p>
      For there were tears in her eyes&mdash;eyes that glistened with happiness&mdash;and
      there was a hand in hers, and as she looked at her husband she knew that
      their hands had clasped each other because they saw the same sweet vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his wife, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I have been the rich man I one day hoped to be&mdash;the
      great merchant I longed to be, when I asked you to marry me&mdash;I could
      have owned nothing&mdash;no diamond&mdash;so dear to me as that very tear
      in your eye. I wanted to be rich&mdash;I felt as if I had cheated you, in
      being so poor and unsuccessful&mdash;you, who were bred so differently.
      For your sake I wanted to be rich.&rdquo; He spoke with a stronger, fuller
      voice. &ldquo;Yes, and when Laura Magot broke my engagement with her
      because of my first failure, I resolved that she should see me one of the
      merchant princes she idolized, and that my wife should be envied by her as
      being the wife of a richer man than Boniface Newt. Darling, you know how I
      struggled for it&mdash;you did not know the secret spur&mdash;and how I
      failed. And I know who it was that made my failure my success, and who
      taught a man who wanted to be rich how to be happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke his wife&rsquo;s arm had stolen tenderly around him. As he
      finished, she said, gently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not such a saint, Gerald.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not, I don&rsquo;t believe in saints,&rdquo; replied her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will prove it to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy you,&rdquo; said Gerald, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Why did you say Lucia in such a tone, a little while ago?&rdquo;
      asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bennet smiled with arch kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I answer truly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under pain of displeasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, slowly, &ldquo;when I heard that Laura Magot&rsquo;s
      husband had failed, as I knew that Lucia Darro&rsquo;s husband had once
      been jilted by Laura Magot because he failed, I could not help wondering&mdash;now,
      Lucia dear, how could I help wondering?&mdash;I wondered how Lucia Darro
      would feel. Because&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a full stop, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because what?&rdquo; asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lingered, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because what?&rdquo; persisted his wife, with mock gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Lucia Darro was a woman, and&mdash;well! I&rsquo;ll make a
      clean breast of it&mdash;and because, although a man and woman love each
      other as long and dearly as Lucia Darro and her husband have and do, there
      is still something in the woman that the man can not quite understand, and
      upon which he is forever experimenting. So I was curious to hear, or
      rather to see and feel, what your thoughts were; and, at the moment I
      spoke, I thought I saw them, and I was surprised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, Sir; and that surprise ought to have shown you that I was
      no saint. Listen again, Sir. Lucia Darro&rsquo;s husband was never jilted
      by Laura Magot, for the impetuous and ambitious young man who was engaged
      to that lady is an entirely different person from my husband. Do you hear,
      Sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; and who made him so entirely different?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Sir! I&rsquo;ve no time to hear such folly. I, too, am going
      to make a clean breast of it, and confess that there was the least little
      sense of&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;well, justice, in my mind, when I thought
      that Laura Magot who jilted you, who were so unfortunate, and with whom
      she might have been so happy&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Bennet dissented, with smiles and shaking head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Sir! Any woman might have been. That she should have led such
      a life with Boniface Newt, and have seen him ruined after all. Poor soul!
      poor soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; asked her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both&mdash;both, Sir. I pity them both from my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou womanest of women!&rdquo; retorted her husband. &ldquo;Art
      thou, therefore, no saint because thou pitiest them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; but because it was not an unmixed pity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, it is an unmixed goodness,&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restless glance, the glimmering uncertainty, had faded from his eyes.
      He sat quietly on the sofa, swinging his foot, and with his head bent a
      little to one side over the limp cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;let us go out, and walk in the
      moonlight too.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXX. &mdash; THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a few moments they were sauntering along the street. It was full and
      murmurous. The lights were bright in the shop windows, and the scuffling
      of footsteps, more audible than during the day, when it is drowned by the
      roar of carriage-wheels upon the pavement, had a friendly, social sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broadway is never so pleasant as in the early evening,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Bennet; &ldquo;for then the rush of the day is over, and people move
      with a leisurely air, as if they were enjoying themselves. What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were going down the street, and saw lights, and heard music and a
      crowd approaching. They came nearer; and Mr. Bennet and his wife turned
      aside, and stood upon the steps of a dwelling-house. A band of music came
      first, playing &ldquo;Hail Columbia!&rdquo; It was surrounded by a swarm
      of men and boys, in the street and on the sidewalk, who shouted, and sang,
      and ran; and it was followed by a file of gentlemen, marching in pairs.
      Several of them carried torches, and occasionally, as they passed under a
      house, they all looked up at the windows, and gave three cheers.
      Sometimes, also, an individual in the throng shouted something which was
      received with loud hi-hi&rsquo;s and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a political procession, my dear. Look! they will not come
      by us at all; they are turning into Grand Street, close by. I suppose they
      are going to call upon some candidate. I never see any crowd of this kind
      without thinking how simple and beautiful our institutions are. Do you
      ever think of it, Lucia? What a majestic thing the popular will is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry, and we may see something,&rdquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throng had left Broadway, and had stopped in Grand Street under a
      balcony in a handsome house. The music had stopped also, and all faces
      were turned toward the balcony. Mr. Bennet and his wife stood at the
      corner of Broadway. Suddenly a gentleman took off his hat and waved it
      violently in the air, and a superb diamond-ring flashed in the torch-light
      as he did so, while he shouted,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for Newt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a burst of huzzas from the crowd&mdash;the drums rolled&mdash;the
      boys shrieked and snarled in the tone of various animals&mdash;the torches
      waved&mdash;one excited man cried, &ldquo;One more!&rdquo;&mdash;there was
      another stentorian yell, and roll, and wave&mdash;after which the band
      played a short air. But the windows did not open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newt! Newt! Newt!&rdquo; shouted the crowd. The young gentleman
      with the diamond-ring disappeared into the house, with several others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Slugby, where the devil is he?&rdquo; said one of them to
      another, in a whisper, as they ran up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Musher promised to have him
      ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I sent Ele up to get here before we did,&rdquo; replied his
      friend, in the same hurried whisper, his fat nose glistening in the
      hall-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached Mr. Newt&rsquo;s room they found him lying upon a sofa,
      while Musher and the Honorable B.J. Ele were trying to get him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n it! stand up, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried Mr.
      Ele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Abel, with a half-humorous
      maudlin smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the impetuous roar of the crowd in the street stole in
      through the closed windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newt! Newt! Newt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in &mdash;&mdash; shall we do?&rdquo; gasped Mr. Enos Slugby,
      walking rapidly up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who let him get drunk?&rdquo; demanded General Belch, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newt! Newt! Newt!&rdquo; surged in from the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder and devils, there&rsquo;s nothing for it but to prop him up
      on the balcony!&rdquo; said General Belch. &ldquo;Come now, heave to,
      every body, and stick him on his pins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked sleepily round, with his eyes half closed and his under lip
      hanging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use,&rdquo; said he, thickly; &ldquo;&lsquo;tain&rsquo;t
      no use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he leered and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perspiring and indignant politicians grasped him&mdash;Slugby and
      William Condor under the arms, Belch on one side, and Ele ready to help
      any where. They raised their friend to his feet, while his head rolled
      slowly round from one side to the other, with a maudlin grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, when they had him fairly on his feet nothing further seemed to be
      possible. They were all holding him and looking very angry, while they
      heard the loud and imperative&mdash;&ldquo;Newt! Newt! Newt!&rdquo;
      accompanied with unequivocal signs of impatience in an occasional stone or
      chip that rattled against the blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of it all the form of the drunken man slipped back upon the
      sofa, and sitting there leaning on his hands, which rested on his knees,
      and with his head heavily hanging forward, he lifted his forehead, and,
      seeing the utterly discomfited group standing perplexed before him, he
      said, with a foolish smile,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of hopeless and helpless inaction. Then suddenly
      General Belch laid his hands upon the sofa on which Abel was lying, and
      moved it toward the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried he to the others, &ldquo;open the blinds, and we&rsquo;ll
      make an end of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enos Slugby raised the window and obeyed. The crowd below, seeing the
      opening blinds and the lights, shouted lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; cried the General, &ldquo;boost him up a moment
      and hold him forward. Heave ho! all together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They raised the inert body, and half-lifted, half-slid it forward upon the
      narrow balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Slugby, you prop him behind; and you, Ele and Condor, one on
      each side. There! that&rsquo;s it! Now we have him. I&rsquo;ll speak to
      the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the General removed his hat and bowed very low to the crowd in
      the street. There was a great shout, &ldquo;Three cheers for Newt!&rdquo;
      and the three cheers rang loudly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t Newt,&rdquo; cried a sharp voice: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      Belch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for Belch!&rdquo; roared an enthusiastic somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; Belch,&rdquo; cried the sharp voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi! hi!&rdquo; roared the chorus; while the torches waved and the
      drums rolled once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time General Arcularius Belch had been bowing profoundly
      and grimacing in dumb show to the crowd, pointing at Abel Newt, who stood,
      ingeniously supported, his real state greatly concealed by the friendly
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; cried Belch, in a piercing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;st! h&rsquo;st! Down, down! Silence,&rdquo; in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I am very sorry to have to inform you that our
      distinguished fellow-citizen, Mr. Newt, to compliment whom you have
      assembled this evening, is so severely unwell (oh! gum! from the
      sharp-voiced skeptic below) that he is entirely unable to address you. But
      so profoundly touched is he by your kindness in coming to compliment him
      by this call, that he could not refuse to appear, though but for a moment,
      to look the thanks he can not speak. At the earliest possible moment he
      promises himself the pleasure of addressing you. Let me, in conclusion,
      propose three cheers for our representative in the next Congress, the
      Honorable Abel Newt. And now&mdash;&rdquo; he whispered to his friends as
      the shouts began, &ldquo;now lug him in again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd cheered, the Honorable Mr. Newt was lugged in, the windows were
      closed, and General Belch and his friends withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is,&rdquo; said he, as they passed up the street
      at a convenient distance behind the crowd, &ldquo;Abel Newt is a man of
      very great talent, but he must take care. By Jove! he must. He must
      understand times and seasons. One thing can not be too often repeated,&rdquo;
      said he, earnestly, &ldquo;if a man expects to succeed in political life
      he must understand when not to be drunk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The merry company laughed, and went home with Mr. William Condor to crack
      a bottle of Champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Bennet had stood at the street corner during the few minutes
      occupied by these events. When they heard the shouts for Newt they had
      looked inquiringly at each other. But when the scene was closed, and the
      cheers for the Honorable Abel Newt, our representative in Congress, had
      died away, they stood for a few moments quite stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean, Gerald?&rdquo; asked his wife. &ldquo;Is Abel
      Newt in Congress?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it. I suppose he is only a candidate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved rapidly away, and his wife, who was not used to speed in his
      walking, smiled quietly, and, could he have seen her eye, a little
      mischievously. She said presently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, our institutions are very simple and beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet said nothing. But she relentlessly continued,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a majestic thing the election of Abel Newt by the popular will
      will be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t laugh until you
      know that it <i>is</i> the popular will; and when you do know it, cry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on silently for some little distance further, and then Gerald
      Bennet turned toward St. John&rsquo;s Square. His wife asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but we have never been there before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he ever failed before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you dear soul! and I am very glad we are going.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LXXI. &mdash; RICHES HAVE WINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They rang at the door of Boniface Newt. It was quite late in the evening,
      and when they entered the parlor there were several persons sitting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! father and mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Gabriel, who was sitting
      in a remote dim corner, and who instantly came forward, with May Newt
      following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt rose and bowed a little stiffly, and said, in an excited voice,
      that really she had no idea, but she was very happy indeed, she was sure,
      and so was Mr. Newt. When she had tied her sentence in an inextricable
      knot, she stopped and seated herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boniface Newt rose slowly and gravely. He was bent like a very old man.
      His eye was hard and dull, and his dry voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do? I am happy to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down again, while Lawrence went up and shook hands with the
      new-comers. Boniface drummed slowly upon his knees with the long, bony
      white fingers, and rocked to and fro mechanically, as he sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lawrence had ended his greetings there was a pause. Mrs. Newt seemed
      to be painfully conscious of it. So did Mr. Bennet, whose eyes wandered
      about the room, resting for a few instants upon Boniface, then sliding
      toward his wife. Boniface himself seemed to be entirely unconscious of any
      pause, or of any person, or of any thing, except some mysterious erratic
      measure that he was beating with the bony fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great while since we have met, Mrs. Newt,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Nancy Newt, rapidly; &ldquo;and now that
      we are to be so very nearly related, it is really high time that we became
      intimate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked, however, very far off from intimacy with the person she
      addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad our children are so happy, Mrs. Newt,&rdquo; said Gerald
      Bennet, in a tremulous voice, with his eyes glimmering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am glad Gabriel&rsquo;s prospects are so good,&rdquo;
      returned Mrs. Newt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt he&rsquo;ll be a very rich
      man very soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had spoken, Boniface Newt, still drumming, turned his face and
      looked quietly at his wife. Nobody spoke. Gabriel only winced at what May&rsquo;s
      mother had said; and they all looked at Boniface. The old man gazed
      fixedly at his wife as if he saw nobody else, and as if he were repeating
      the words to which the bony fingers beat time. He said, in a cold, dry
      voice, still beating time,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Boniface, I know that, if any body does,&rdquo;
      said his wife, pettishly, and in a half-whimpering voice. &ldquo;I think
      we&rsquo;ve all learned that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo; he said, beating with
      the bony fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Boniface,&rdquo; said his wife, with an air of offended
      propriety, &ldquo;I see no occasion for such pointed allusions to our
      misfortunes. It is certainly in very bad taste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo; persisted her husband,
      still gazing at her, and still beating time with the white bony fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Newt&rsquo;s whimpering broadened into crying. She sat weeping and
      wiping her eyes, in the way which used to draw down a storm from her
      husband. There was no storm now. Only the same placid stare&mdash;only the
      same measured refrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt laid his hand gently on his brother&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boniface, you did your best. We all did what we thought best and
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned his eyes from his wife and went on silently drumming,
      looking at the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; said Lawrence, &ldquo;as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are
      about to be a part of the family, I see no reason for not saying to them
      that provision is made for your husband&rsquo;s support. His affairs are
      as bad as they can be; but you and he shall not suffer. Of course you will
      leave this house, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! What will people say? Nobody&rsquo;ll come to see us in a
      small house. What will Mrs. Orry say?&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her say what she chooses, Nancy. What will honest people say to
      whom your husband owes honest debts, if you don&rsquo;t try to pay them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not my debts, and I don&rsquo;t see why I should suffer
      for them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Newt, vehemently, and crying. &ldquo;When I
      married him he said I should ride in my carriage; and if he&rsquo;s been a
      fool, why should I be a beggar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was profound silence in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very hard,&rdquo; said she, querulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless for Lawrence to argue. He saw it, and merely remarked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house will be sold, and you&rsquo;ll give up the carriage and
      live as plainly as you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of coming to this!&rdquo; burst out Mrs. Newt afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a noise was heard in the hall, and the door opened to admit Mr. and
      Mrs. Alfred Dinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time they had entered her father&rsquo;s house since her
      marriage. May, who had been the last person Fanny had seen in her old
      home, ran forward to greet her, and said, cheerfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome home, Fanny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks looked defiantly about the room. Her keen black eyes saw every
      body, and involuntarily every body looked at her&mdash;except her father.
      He seemed quite unconscious of any new-comers. Alfred&rsquo;s heavy figure
      dropped into a chair, whence his small eyes, grown sullen, stared stupidly
      about. Mrs. Newt merely said, hurriedly, &ldquo;Why Fanny!&rdquo; and
      looked, from the old habit of alarm and apprehension, at her husband, then
      back again to her daughter. The silence gradually became oppressive, until
      Fanny broke it by saying, in a dull tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Uncle Lawrence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He simply bowed his head, as if it had been a greeting. Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s
      foot twitched rather than wagged, and his wife turned toward him, from
      time to time, with a tender smile. Mrs. Newt, like one at a funeral,
      presently began to weep afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant family party!&rdquo; broke in the voice of Fanny, clear
      and hard as her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo; repeated the gray old
      man, drumming with lean white fingers upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will nobody tell me any thing?&rdquo; said Fanny, looking sharply
      round. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to be done? Are we all beggars?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo; answered the stern
      voice of the old man, whose eyes were still fixed upon the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny turned toward him half angrily, but her black eyes quailed before
      the changed figure of her father. She recalled the loud, domineering,
      dogmatic man, insisting, morning and night, that as soon as he was rich
      enough he would be all that he wanted to be&mdash;the self-important,
      patronizing, cold, and unsympathetic head of the family. Where was he? Who
      was this that sat in the parlor, in his chair, no longer pompous and
      fierce, but bowed, gray, drumming on his thin knees with lean white
      fingers?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; exclaimed Fanny, involuntarily, and terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned his head toward her. The calm, hard eyes looked into
      hers. There was no expression of surprise, or indignation, or forgiveness&mdash;nothing
      but a placid abstraction and vagueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Fanny repeated, rising, and half moving toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head turned back again&mdash;his eyes looked at the wall&mdash;and she
      heard only the words, &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Fanny sank back into her chair, pale and appalled, May took her hand
      and began to talk with her in a low, murmuring tone. The others fell into
      a fragmentary conversation, constantly recurring with their eyes to Mr.
      Newt. The talk went on in broken whispers, and it was quite late in the
      evening when a stumbling step advanced to the door, which was burst open,
      and there stood Abel Newt, with his hat crushed, his clothes soiled, his
      jaw hanging, and his eyes lifted in a drunken leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do?&rdquo; he said, leaning against the door-frame and nodding
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother, who had never before seen him in such a condition, glanced at
      him, and uttered a frightened cry. Lawrence Newt and Gabriel rose, and,
      going toward him, took his arms and tried to lead him out. Abel had no
      kindly feeling for either of them. His brow lowered, and the sullen
      blackness shot into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands off!&rdquo; he cried, in a threatening tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They still urged him out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands off!&rdquo; he said again, looking at Lawrence Newt, and then
      in a sneering tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the Reverend Gabriel Bennet! Come, I licked you like&mdash;like&mdash;like
      hell once, and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;do it
      again. Stand back!&rdquo; he shouted, with drunken energy, and struggling
      to free his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gabriel and Lawrence Newt held fast. The others rose and stood looking
      on, Mrs. Newt hysterically weeping, and May pale with terror. Alfred Dinks
      laughed, foolishly, and gazed about for sympathy. Gerald Bennet drew his
      wife&rsquo;s arm within his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sat quietly, only turning his head toward the noise, and
      looking at the struggle without appearing to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding himself mastered, Abel swore and struggled with drunken frenzy.
      After a little while he was entirely exhausted, and sank upon the floor.
      Lawrence Newt and Gabriel stood panting over him; the rest crowded into
      the hall. Abel looked about stupidly, then crawled toward the staircase,
      laid his head upon the lower step, and almost immediately fell into a
      deep, drunken slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; whispered Gerald Bennet to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took Mrs. Newt&rsquo;s hand and said Good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me! isn&rsquo;t it dreadful?&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Please
      don&rsquo;t, say any thing about it. Good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook her hand, but as they opened the door into the still moonlight
      midnight they heard the clear, hard voice in the parlor, and in their
      minds they saw the beating of the bony fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches have wings! Riches have wings!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXII. &mdash; GOOD-BY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The happy hours of Hope Wayne&rsquo;s life were the visits of Lawrence
      Newt. The sound of his voice in the hall, of his step on the stair, gave
      her a sense of profound peace. Often, as she sat at table with Mrs.
      Simcoe, in her light morning-dress, and with the dew of sleep yet fresh
      upon her cheeks, she heard the sound, and her heart seemed to stop and
      listen. Often, as time wore on, and the interviews were longer and more
      delayed, she was conscious that the gaze of her old friend became
      curiously fixed upon her whenever Lawrence Newt came. Often, in the
      tranquil evenings, when they sat together in the pleasant room, Hope Wayne
      cheerfully chatting, or sewing, or reading aloud, Mrs. Simcoe looked at
      her so wistfully&mdash;so as if upon the point of telling some strange
      story&mdash;that Hope could not help saying, brightly, &ldquo;Out with it,
      aunty!&rdquo; But as the younger woman spoke, the resolution glimmered
      away in the eyes of her companion, and was succeeded by a yearning, tender
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Lawrence Newt came to the house, to consult, to inspect, to bring
      bills that he had paid, to hear of a new utensil for the kitchen, to see
      about coal, about wood, about iron, to look at a dipper, at a faucet&mdash;he
      knew every thing in the house by heart, and yet he did not know how or
      why. He wanted to come&mdash;he thought he came too often. What could he
      do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope sang as she sat in her chamber, as she read in the parlor, as she
      went about the house, doing her nameless, innumerable household duties.
      Her voice was rich, and full, and womanly; and the singing was not the
      fragmentary, sparkling gush of good spirits, and the mere overflow of a
      happy temperament&mdash;it was a deep, sweet, inward music, as if a woman&rsquo;s
      soul were intoning a woman&rsquo;s thoughts, and as if the woman were at
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the face of Mrs. Simcoe grew sadder and sadder as Hope&rsquo;s singing
      was sweeter and sweeter, and significant of utter rest. The look in her
      eyes of something imminent, of something that even trembled on her tongue,
      grew more and more marked. Hope Wayne brightly said, &ldquo;Out with it,
      aunty!&rdquo; and sang on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring came often to the house. She was older than Hope, and it was
      natural that she should be a little graver. They had a hundred plans in
      concert for helping a hundred people. Amy and Hope were a charitable
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddle diddle!&rdquo; said Aunt Dagon, when she was speaking of his
      two friends to her nephew Lawrence. &ldquo;Does this brace of angels think
      that virtue consists in making shirts for poor people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence looked at his aunt with the inscrutable eyes, and answered
      slowly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that they do, Aunt Dagon; but I suppose they don&rsquo;t
      think it consists in <i>not</i> making them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dagon, tossing her cap-strings back
      pettishly. &ldquo;I suppose they expect to make a kind of rope-ladder of
      all their charity garments, and climb up into heaven that way!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they do,&rdquo; replied Lawrence, in the same tone. &ldquo;They
      have not made me their confidant. But I suppose that even if the ladder
      doesn&rsquo;t reach, it&rsquo;s better to go a little way up than not to
      start at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Lawrence, such a speech as that comes of your not going to
      church. If you would just try to be a little better man, and go to hear
      Dr. Maundy preach, say once a year,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dagon, sarcastically,
      &ldquo;you would learn that it isn&rsquo;t good works that are the
      necessary thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, Aunt Dagon,&rdquo; returned Lawrence, laughing&mdash;&ldquo;I
      do really hope that it&rsquo;s good words, then, for your sake. My dear
      aunt, you ought to be satisfied with showing that you don&rsquo;t believe
      in good works, and let other people enjoy their own faith. If charity be a
      sin, Miss Amy Waring and Miss Hope Wayne are dreadful sinners. But then,
      Aunt Dagon, what a saint you must be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually Mrs. Simcoe was persuaded that she ought to speak plainly to
      Lawrence Newt upon a subject which profoundly troubled her. Having
      resolved to do it, she sat one morning waiting patiently for the door of
      the library&mdash;in which Lawrence Newt was sitting with Hope Wayne,
      discussing the details of her household&mdash;to open. There was a placid
      air of resolution in her sad and anxious face, as if she were only
      awaiting the moment when she should disburden her heart of the weight it
      had so long secretly carried. There was entire silence in the house. The
      rich curtains, the soft carpet, the sumptuous furniture&mdash;every object
      on which the eye fell, seemed made to steal the shock from noise; and the
      rattle of the street&mdash;the jarring of carts&mdash;the distant shriek
      of the belated milkman&mdash;the long, wavering, melancholy cry of the
      chimney-sweep&mdash;came hushed and indistinct into the parlor where the
      sad-eyed woman sat silently waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the door opened and Lawrence Newt came out. He was going toward
      the front door, when Mrs. Simcoe rose and went into the hall, and said,
      &ldquo;Stop a moment!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, half smiled, but saw her face, and his own settled into its
      armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe beckoned him toward the parlor; and as he went in she stepped
      to the library door and said, to avoid interruption,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope, Mr. Newt and I are talking together in the parlor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope bowed, and made no reply. Mrs. Simcoe entered the other room and
      closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;you can not
      wonder that I am anxious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, perhaps, more than you know,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;not, I
      am sure, more than you suspect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was a little troubled, but it was only evident in the quiet
      closing and unclosing of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood for a few moments without speaking. Then she opened the
      miniature, and when she saw that he observed it she said, very slowly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it quite fair, Mr. Newt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Simcoe,&rdquo; he replied, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His firm, low voice reassured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you come here so often?&rdquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To help Miss Hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessary that you should come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wishes it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment. Mrs. Simcoe continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence Newt, at least let us be candid with each other. By the
      memory of the dead&mdash;by the common sorrow we have known, there should
      be no cloud between us about Hope Wayne. I use your own words. Tell me
      what you feel as frankly as you feel it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was simple truth in the earnest face before him. While she was
      speaking she raised her hand involuntarily to her breast, and gasped as if
      she were suffocating. Her words were calm, and he answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited, for I did not know how to answer&mdash;nor do I now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you have had some impression&mdash;some feeling&mdash;some
      conviction. Yon know whether it is necessary that you should come&mdash;whether
      she wants you for an hour&rsquo;s chat, as an old friend&mdash;or&mdash;or&rdquo;&mdash;she
      waited a moment, and added&mdash;&ldquo;or as something else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lawrence Newt stood before her he remembered curiously his interview
      with Aunt Martha, but he could not say to Mrs. Simcoe what he had said to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo; he asked at length, in a troubled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence Newt, say if you think she loves you, and tell me,&rdquo;
      she said, drawing herself erect and back from him, as in the twilight of
      the old library at Pinewood, while her thin finger was pointed upward&mdash;&ldquo;tell
      me, as you will be judged hereafter&mdash;me, to whom her mother gave her
      as she died, knowing that she loved you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice died away, overpowered by emotion. She still looked at him, and
      suspicion, incredulity, and scorn were mingled in her look, while her
      uplifted finger still shook, as if appealing to Heaven. Then she asked
      abruptly, and fiercely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To which, in the name of God, are you false&mdash;the mother or the
      daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; replied Lawrence Newt, in a tone so imperious that the
      hand of his companion fell at her side, and the scorn and suspicion faded
      from her eyes. &ldquo;Mrs. Simcoe, there are things that even you must not
      say. You have lived alone with a great sorrow; you are too swift; you are
      unjust. Even if I had known what you ask about Miss Hope, I am not sure
      that I should have done differently. Certainly, while I did not know&mdash;while,
      at most, I could only suspect, I could do nothing else. I have feared
      rather than believed&mdash;nor that, until very lately. Would it have been
      kind, or wise, or right to have staid away altogether, when, as you know,
      I constantly meet her at our little Club? Was I to say, &lsquo;Miss Hope,
      I see you love me, but I do not love you?&rsquo; And what right had I to
      hint the same thing by my actions, at the cost of utter misapprehension
      and pain to her? Mrs. Simcoe, I do love Hope Wayne too tenderly, and
      respect her too truly, not to try to protect her against the sting of her
      own womanly pride. And so I have not staid away. I have not avoided a
      woman in whom I must always have so deep and peculiar an interest, I have
      been friend and almost father, and never by a whisper even, by a look, by
      a possible hint, have I implied any thing more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice trembled as he spoke. He had no right to be silent any longer,
      and as he finished Mrs. Simcoe took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! I love her so dearly&mdash;and I too am a woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank upon the sofa as she spoke, and covered her face for a little
      while. The tears stole quietly down her cheeks. Lawrence Newt stood by her
      sadly, for his mind was deeply perplexed. They both remained for some time
      without speaking, until Mrs. Simcoe asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt shook his head doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent again. At length Mrs. Simcoe said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have been meaning to do for a long, long time,&rdquo;
      replied the other. &ldquo;I will tell her the story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An indefinable expression settled upon Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s face as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she never asked?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often; but I have always avoided telling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had better be done. It is the only way. But I hoped it would
      never be necessary. God bless us all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved toward the door when he had finished, but not until he had shaken
      her warmly by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come as before?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, there will not be the slightest change on my part. And,
      Mrs. Simcoe, remember that next week, certainly, I shall meet Miss Hope at
      Miss Amy Waring&rsquo;s. Our first meeting had better be there, so before
      then please&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and went out. As he passed the library door he involuntarily
      looked in. There sat Hope Wayne, reading; but as she heard him she raised
      the head of golden hair, the dewy cheeks, the thoughtful brow, and as she
      bowed to him the clear blue eyes smiled the words her tongue uttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Newt, good-by!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words followed him out of the door and down the street. The air rang
      with them every where. The people he passed seemed to look at him as if
      they were repeating them. Distant echoes caught them up and whispered
      them. He heard no noise of carriages, no loud city hum; he only heard,
      fainter and fainter, softer and softer, sadder and sadder, and ever
      following on, &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Newt, good-by!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXIII. &mdash; THE BELCH PLATFORM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Newt, as a friend who has the highest respect for you, and
      the firmest faith in your future, I am sure you will allow me to say one
      thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly, my dear Belch; say two,&rdquo; replied Abel, with
      the utmost suavity, as he sat at table with General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no peculiar ability, I know,&rdquo; continued the other,
      &ldquo;but I have, perhaps, a little more experience than you. We old men,
      you know, always plume ourselves upon experience, which we make do duty
      for all the virtues and talents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is trained for that service by being merely a synonym for a
      knowledge of all the sins and rascalities,&rdquo; said Abel, smiling, as
      he blew rings of smoke and passed the decanter to General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;very true. I see, my dear
      Newt, that you have had your eyes and your mind open. And since we are
      going to act together&mdash;since, in fact, we are interested in the same
      plans&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And principles,&rdquo; interrupted Abel, laying his head back, and
      looking with half-closed eyes at the vanishing smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I was coming to that&mdash;in the same plans and
      principles, it is well that we should understand each other perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch paused, looked at Abel, and took snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we do already,&rdquo; replied Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still there are one or two points to which I would call your
      attention. One is, that you can not be too careful of what you say, in
      regard to its bearing upon the party; and the other is, a general rule
      that the Public is an ass, but you must never let it know you think so. If
      there is one thing which the party has practically proved, it is that the
      people have no will of their own, but are sheep in the hands of the
      shepherd.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The General took snuff again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Public, then, is an ass and a sheep?&rdquo; inquired Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;an ass in capacity, and in
      preference of a thistle diet; a sheep in gregarious and stupid following.
      You say &lsquo;Ca, ca, ca,&rsquo; when you want a cow to follow you; and
      you say &lsquo;Glorious old party,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Intelligence of the
      people,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Preference of truth to victory,&rsquo; and so
      forth, when you want the people to follow you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ass, a sheep, and a cow,&rdquo; said Abel. &ldquo;To what other
      departments of natural history do the people belong, General?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adders,&rdquo; returned Belch, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Abel, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they are so cold and ungrateful,&rdquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As when, for instance,&rdquo; returned Abel, &ldquo;the Honorable
      Watkins Bodley, having faithfully served his constituency, is turned
      adrift by&mdash;by&mdash;the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Belch and laughed. The fat nose of the General glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your illustration is at fault. He
      did not faithfully serve his constituency. He was not sound upon the great
      Grant question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen laughed together and filled their glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; resumed the General, &ldquo;never forget that the
      great thing is drill&mdash;discipline. Keep the machinery well oiled, and
      your hand upon the crank, and all goes well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until somebody knocks off your hand,&rdquo; said Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course&mdash;of course; but that is the very point. The
      fight is never among the sheep, but only among the shepherds. Look at our
      splendid system, beginning with Tom, Jim, and Ned, and culminating in the
      President&mdash;the roots rather red and unsightly, but oh! such a pretty
      flower, all broadcloth, kid gloves, and affability&mdash;contemplate the
      superb machinery,&rdquo; continued the General, warming, &ldquo;the
      primaries, the ward committees, the&mdash;in fact, all the rest of it&mdash;see
      how gloriously it works&mdash;the great result of the working of the whole
      is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, promote the
      general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
      posterity,&rdquo; interrupted Abel, who had been scanning the
      Constitution, and who delivered the words with a rhetorical pomp of
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch smiled approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the very tone. You&rsquo;ll do.
      The great result is, who shall have his hand on the crank. And there are,
      therefore, always three parties in our beloved country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, the <i>ins</i>, who are in two parties&mdash;the clique that
      have, and the clique that haven&rsquo;t. They fight like fury among
      themselves, but when they meet t&rsquo;other great party they all fight
      together, because the hopes of the crank for each individual of each body
      lie in the party itself, and in their obedience to its discipline. These
      are two of the parties. Then there is the great party of the <i>outs</i>,
      who have a marvelous unanimity, and never break up into quarrelsome bodies
      until there is a fair chance of their ousting the <i>ins</i>. I say these
      things not because they are not pretty obvious, but because, as a man of
      fashion and society, you have probably not attended to such matters. It&rsquo;s
      dirty work for a gentleman. But I suppose any of us would be willing to
      pick a gold eagle out of the mud, even if we did soil our fingers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Abel, in a tone that General Belch did
      not entirely comprehend&mdash;&ldquo;of course no gentleman knows any
      thing of politics. Gentlemen are the natural governors of a country; and
      where they are not erected into a hereditary governing class, self-respect
      forbids them to mix with inferior men&mdash;so they keep aloof from public
      affairs. Good Heavens! what gentleman would be guilty of being an alderman
      in this town! Why, as you know, my dear Belch, nothing but my reduced
      circumstances induces me to go to Congress. By-the-by&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; asked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully hard up,&rdquo; said Abel. &ldquo;I have just
      the d&mdash;&mdash;est luck you ever conceived, and I must raise some
      money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat nose glistened again, while the General sat silently pondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can lend you a thousand,&rdquo; he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. It will oblige me very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon conditions,&rdquo; added the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conditions?&rdquo; asked Abel, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean understandings,&rdquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; answered Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pledge yourself to me and our friends that you will at the
      earliest moment move in the matter of the Grant; you engage to secure the
      votes somehow, relying upon the pecuniary aid of our friends who are
      interested; and you will repay me out of your first receipts. Ele will
      stand by you through thick and thin. We keep him there for that purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Belch, I promise any thing you require. I only want the
      money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand, Newt. From the bottom of my soul I do respect a
      man who has no scruples.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands heartily, and filling their glasses they drank &ldquo;Success!&rdquo;
      The General then wrote a check and a little series of instructions, which
      he gave to Abel, while Abel himself scribbled an I.O.U., which the General
      laid in his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have an eye on, Ele,&rdquo; said the General, as he
      buttoned his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;two if you want,&rdquo; answered Abel, lazily,
      repeating the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good fellow, Ele is,&rdquo; said Belch; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s
      largely interested, and he&rsquo;ll probably try to chouse us out of
      something by affecting superior influence. You must patronize him to the
      other men. Keep him well under. I have a high respect for cellar stairs,
      but they mustn&rsquo;t try to lead up to the roof. Good-by. Hail Newt!
      Senator that shall be!&rdquo; laughed the General, as he shook hands and
      followed his fat nose out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, Abel walked for some time up and down his room, with his
      hands buried in his pocket and a sneering smile upon his face. He suddenly
      drew one hand out, raised it, clenched it, and brought it down heavily in
      the air, as he muttered, contemptuously,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a stupid fool! I wonder if he never thinks, as he looks in the
      glass, that that fat nose of his is made to lead him by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sagacious and fat-nosed General had omitted to look at the little
      paper Newt handed to him, thinking it would be hardly polite to do so
      under the circumstances. But if he had looked he would have seen that the
      exact sum they had spoken of had been forgotten, and a very inconsiderable
      amount was specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had flashed across Abel&rsquo;s mind in a moment that if the General
      subsequently discovered it and were disposed to make trouble, the
      disclosure of the paper of instructions which he had written, and which
      Abel had in his possession, would ruin his hopes of political
      financiering. &ldquo;And as for my election, why, I have my certificate in
      my pocket.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXIV. &mdash; MIDNIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gradually the sneer faded from Abel&rsquo;s face, and he walked up and
      down the room, no longer carelessly, but fitfully; stopping sometimes&mdash;again
      starting more rapidly&mdash;then leaning against the mantle, on which the
      clock pointed to midnight&mdash;then throwing himself into a chair or upon
      a sofa; and so, rising again, walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head bent forward&mdash;his eyes grew rounder and harder, and seemed
      to be burnished with the black, bad light; his step imperceptibly grew
      stealthy&mdash;he looked about him carefully&mdash;he stood erect and
      breathless to listen&mdash;bit his nails, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock upon the mantle pointed to half an hour after midnight. Abel
      Newt went into his chamber and put on his slippers. He lighted a candle,
      and looked carefully under the bed and in the closet. Then he drew the
      shades over the windows and went out into the other room, closing and
      locking the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glided noiselessly to the door that opened into the entry, and locked
      that softly and bolted it carefully. Then he turned the key so that the
      wards filled the keyhole, and taking out his handkerchief he hung it over
      the knob of the door, so that it fell across the keyhole, and no eye could
      by any chance have peered into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that the blinds of the windows were closed, the windows shut and
      locked, and the linen shades drawn over them. He also let fall the heavy
      damask curtains, so that the windows were obliterated from the room. He
      stood in the centre of the room and looked to every corner where, by any
      chance, a person might be concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, moving upon tip-toe, he drew a key from his pocket and fitted it
      into the lid of a secretary. As he turned it in the lock the snap of the
      bolt made him start. He was haggard, even ghastly, as he stood, letting
      the lid back slowly, lest it should creak or jar. With another key he
      opened a little drawer, and involuntarily looking behind him as he did so,
      he took out a small piece of paper, which he concealed in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seating himself at the secretary, he put the candle before him, and
      remained for a moment with his face slightly strained forward with a
      startling intentness of listening. There was no sound but the regular
      ticking of the clock upon the mantle. He had not observed it before, but
      now he could hear nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tick, tick&mdash;tick, tick. It had a persistent, relentless, remorseless
      regularity. Tick, tick&mdash;tick, tick. Every moment it appeared to be
      louder and louder. His brow wrinkled and his head bent forward more
      deeply, while his eyes were set straight before him. Tick, tick&mdash;tick,
      tick. The solemn beat became human as he listened. He could not raise his
      head&mdash;he could not turn his eyes. He felt as if some awful shape
      stood over him with destroying eyes and inflexible tongue. But struggling,
      without moving, as a dreamer wrestles with the nightmare, he presently
      sprang bolt upright&mdash;his eyes wide and wild&mdash;the sweat oozing
      upon his ghastly forehead&mdash;his whole frame weak and quivering. With
      the same suddenness he turned defiantly, clenching his fists, in act to
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing there. He saw only the clock&mdash;the gilt pendulum
      regularly swinging&mdash;he heard only the regular tick, tick&mdash;tick,
      tick.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sickly smile glimmered on his face as he stepped toward the mantle,
      still clutching the paper in his hand, but crouching as he came, and
      leering, as if to leap upon an enemy unawares. Suddenly he started as if
      struck&mdash;a stifled shriek of horror burst from his lips&mdash;he
      staggered back&mdash;his hand opened&mdash;the paper fell fluttering to
      the floor. Abel Newt had unexpectedly seen the reflection of his own face
      in the mirror that covered the chimney behind the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recovered himself, swore bitterly, and stooped to pick up the paper.
      Then with sullen bravado, still staring at his reflection in the glass, he
      took off the glass shade of the clock, touched the pendulum and stopped
      it; then turning his back, crept to his chair, and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was profound, not a sound was audible but the creaking of his
      clothes as he leaned heavily against the edge of the desk and drew his
      agitated breath. He raised the candle and bent his gloomy face over the
      paper which he held before him. It was a note of his late firm indorsed by
      Lawrence Newt &amp; Co. He gazed at his uncle&rsquo;s signature intently,
      studying every line, every dot&mdash;so intently that it seemed as if his
      eyes would burn it. Then putting down the candle and spreading the name
      before him, he drew a sheet of tissue paper from a drawer and placed it
      over it. The writing was perfectly legible&mdash;the finest stroke showed
      through the thin tissue. He filled a pen and carefully drew the lines of
      the signature upon the tissue paper&mdash;then raised it&mdash;the
      fac-simile was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a thicker piece of paper, he laid the note before him, and slowly,
      carefully, copied the signature. The result was a resemblance, but nothing
      more. He held the paper in the flame of the candle until it was consumed.
      He tried again. He tried many times. Each trial was a greater success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tearing a check from his book he filled the blanks and wrote below the
      name of Lawrence Newt &amp; Co., and found, upon comparison with the
      indorsement, that it was very like. Abel Newt grinned; his lips moved: he
      was muttering &ldquo;Dear Uncle Lawrence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped writing, and carefully burned, as before, the check and all the
      paper. Then covering his face with his hands as he sat, he said to
      himself, as the hot, hurried thoughts flickered through his mind,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mrs. Lawrence Newt, I shall not be master of Pinewood,
      but I shall be of your husband, and he will be master of your property.
      Practice makes perfect. Dear Uncle Lawrence shall be my banker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His brain reeled and whirled as he sat. He remembered the words of his
      friend the General: &ldquo;Abel Newt was not born to fail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by God!&rdquo; he shouted, springing up, and clenching his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staggered. The walls of the room, the floor, the ceiling, the furniture
      heaved and rolled before his eyes. In the wild tumult that overwhelmed his
      brain as if he were sinking in gurgling whirlpools&mdash;the peaceful lawn
      of Pinewood&mdash;the fight with Gabriel&mdash;the running horses&mdash;the
      &ldquo;Farewell forever, Miss Wayne&rdquo;&mdash;the shifting chances of
      his subsequent life&mdash;Grace Plumer blazing with diamonds&mdash;the
      figure of his father drumming with white fingers upon his office-desk&mdash;Lawrence
      and Gabriel pushing him out&mdash;they all swept before his consciousness
      in the moment during which he threw out his hands wildly, clutched at the
      air, and plunged headlong upon the floor, senseless.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXV. &mdash; REMINISCENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the very evening that General Belch and Abel Newt were sitting
      together, smoking, taking snuff, sipping wine, and discussing the great
      principles that should control the action of American legislators and
      statesmen, Hope Wayne and Mrs. Simcoe sat together in their pleasant
      drawing-room talking of old times. The fire crackled upon the hearth, and
      the bright flames flickering through the room brought out every object
      with fitful distinctness. The lamp was turned almost out&mdash;for they
      found it more agreeable to sit in a twilight as they spoke of the days
      which seemed to both of them to be full of subdued and melancholy light.
      They sat side by side; Hope leaning her cheek upon her hand, and gazing
      thoughtfully into the fire; Mrs. Simcoe turned partly toward her, and
      occasionally studying her face, as if peculiarly anxious to observe its
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have happened in many ways that they were speaking of the old
      times. The older woman may have intentionally led the conversation in that
      direction for some ulterior purpose she had in view. Or what is more
      likely than that the young woman should constantly draw her friend and
      guardian to speak of days and people connected with her own life, but
      passed before her memory had retained them?
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long interval, as if, when she had once broken her reserve about
      her life, she must pour out all her experience, Mrs. Simcoe began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was twenty years old, living with my father, a poor farmer
      in the country, there came to pass the summer in the village a gentleman,
      a good deal older than I. He was handsome, graceful, elegant, fascinating.
      I saw him at church, but he did not see me. Then I met him sometimes upon
      the road, idly sauntering along, swinging a little cane, and looking as if
      village life were fatiguing. He seemed at length to observe me. One day he
      bowed. I said nothing, but hurried on. When I was a little beyond him I
      turned my head. He also was turning and looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was old enough to know why I turned. Yes, and so was he. How well
      I remember the peaceful western light that fell along the fields and
      touched the trees so kindly! Every thing was still. The birds dropped
      hurrying homeward notes, and the cows were coming in from the pasture. I
      was going after our cow, but I leaned a long time on the bars and looked
      at the new moon timidly showing herself in the west. Then I looked at my
      clumsy gown, and thick shoes, and large hands, and thought of the
      graceful, elegant man, who had not bowed to me insolently. I imagined that
      a gentleman used to city life must find our country ways tiresome. I
      pitied him, but what could I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once in the meadows I was following up the brook to find cardinal
      flowers. The brook wound through a little wood; and as I was passing,
      looking closely among the flags and pickerel-wood, I suddenly heard a
      voice close to me&mdash;&lsquo;The lobelia blossoms are further on, Miss
      Jane.&rsquo; I knew instantly who it was, and I was conscious of being
      more scarlet than the flowers I was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Simcoe, after pausing for a few
      moments, &ldquo;I can not repeat every detail. The time came when I was
      not afraid to speak to him&mdash;when I cared to speak to no one else&mdash;when
      I thought of him all day and dreamed of him all night&mdash;when I wore
      the ribbons he praised, and the colors he loved, and the flowers he gave
      me; when he told me of the great life beyond the village, of lofty and
      beautiful women he had known, of wise men he had seen, of the foreign
      countries he had visited&mdash;when he twined my hair around his finger
      and said, &lsquo;Jane, I love you!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were excited, and her voice was hurried, but inexpressibly sad.
      Hope sat by, and the tears flowed from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long, long time. Yet it was only a few months&mdash;it was only a
      summer. He came in May, and was gone again in November. But between his
      coming and going the roses in our garden blossomed and withered. So you
      see there was time enough. Time enough! Time enough! I was heavenly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day he said that he must go. There was some frightful trouble
      in his eye. &lsquo;Will you come back?&rsquo; I asked. I tremble to
      remember how sternly I asked it, and how cold and bloodless I felt.
      &lsquo;So help me God!&rsquo; he answered, and left me. Left me! &lsquo;So
      help me God!&rsquo; he murmured, as his tears fell upon my cheek and he
      kissed me. &lsquo;So help me God!&rsquo;&mdash;and he left me. Not a word,
      not a look, not a sign had he given me to suppose that he would not
      return; not a thought, not a wish had he breathed to me that you might not
      hear. His miniature hung in a locket around my neck, even as my whole
      heart and soul hung upon his love. &lsquo;So help me God!&rsquo; he
      whispered, and left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not come back. I thought my heart was frozen. My mother
      sighed as she went on with her hard, incessant work. My father tried to be
      cheerful. &lsquo;Cry, girl, cry,&rsquo; my mother said; &lsquo;only cry,
      and you&rsquo;ll be better.&rsquo; I could not cry; I could not smile. I
      could do nothing but help her silently in the long, hard work, day after
      day, summer and winter. I read the books he had given me. I thought of the
      things he had said. I sat in my chamber when the floor was scrubbed, and
      the bread baked, and the dishes washed, and the flies buzzed in the hot,
      still kitchen. I can hear them now. And there I sat, looking out of my
      window, straining my eyes toward the horizon&mdash;sometimes sure that I
      heard him coming, clicking the gate, hurrying up the gravel, with his
      eager, handsome, melancholy face. I started up. My heart stood still. I
      was ready to fall upon his breast and say, &lsquo;I believe &lsquo;twas
      all right.&rsquo; He did not come. &lsquo;So help me God!&rsquo; he said,
      and did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father brought me to New York to change the scene. But God had
      brought me here to change my heart. I heard one Sunday good old Bishop
      Asbury, and he began the work that Summerfield sealed. My parents
      presently died. They left nothing, and I was the only child. I did what I
      could, and at last I became your grandfather&rsquo;s housekeeper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As her story proceeded Mrs. Simcoe looked more and more anxiously at Hope,
      whose eyes were fixed upon her incessantly. The older woman paused at this
      point, and, taking Hope&rsquo;s face between her hands, smoothed her hair,
      and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandfather had a daughter Mary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; said Hope, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother, darling. She was as beautiful but as delicate as a
      flower. The doctors said a long salt voyage would strengthen her. So your
      grandfather sent her in the ship of one of his friends to India. In India
      she staid several weeks, and met a young man of her own age, clerk in a
      house there. Of course they were soon engaged. But he was young, not yet
      in business, and she knew the severity of your grandfather and his
      ambition for her. At length the ship returned, and your mother returned in
      it. Scarcely was she at home a month than your grandfather told me that he
      had a connection in view for his daughter, and wanted me to prepare her to
      receive the addresses of a gentleman a good deal older than she, but of
      the best family, and in every way a desirable husband. He was himself
      getting old, he said, and it was necessary that his daughter should marry.
      Your mother loved me dearly, as I did her. Gentle soul, with her soft,
      dark, appealing eyes, with her flower-like fragility and womanly
      dependence. Ah me! it was hard that your grandfather should have been her
      parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was stunned when I told her. I thought her grief was only
      natural, and I was surprised at the sudden change in her. She faded before
      our eyes. We could not cheer her. But she made no effort to resist. She
      did not refuse to see her suitor; she did not say that she loved any one
      else. I think she had a mortal fear of her father, and, dear soul! she
      could not do any thing that required resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day your grandfather said at dinner, &lsquo;To-morrow, Miss
      Mary, your new friend will be here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All night she lay awake, trembling and tearful; and at morning she
      rose like a spectre. The stranger arrived. Mary kept her room until
      dinner-time. Then we both went down to see the new-comer. He was in the
      library with your grandfather, and was engaged in telling him some very
      amusing story when we came in, for your grandfather was laughing heartily.
      They both rose upon seeing us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Colonel Wayne, my daughter,&rsquo; said your grandfather,
      waving his hand toward her. He bowed&mdash;she sank, spectre-like, into a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Simcoe, Colonel Wayne.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our eyes met. It was my lover. He was too much amazed to bow. But
      in a moment he recovered himself, smiled courteously, and seated himself;
      for he saw at once what place I filled in the household. I said nothing. I
      remember that I sank into a chair and looked at him. He was older, but the
      same charm still hovered about his person. His voice had the same secret
      music, and his movement that careless grace which seemed to spring from
      the consciousness of power. I was conscious of only two things&mdash;that
      I loved him, and that he was unworthy the love of any woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During dinner he made two or three observations to me. But I bowed
      and said nothing. I think I was morally stunned, and the whole scene
      seemed to me to be unreal. After a few days he made a formal offer of his
      hand to Mary Burt. Poor child! Poor child! She trembled, hesitated,
      fluttered, delayed. &lsquo;You must; you shall!&rsquo; were the terrible
      words she heard from her parent. She dreaded to tell the truth, lest he
      should force a summary marriage. Hope, my child, you could have resisted&mdash;so
      could I; she could not. &lsquo;Only, dear father,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I
      am so young. Let me not be married for a year.&rsquo; Her father laughed
      and assented, and I think she instantly wrote to her lover in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People came driving out to congratulate. &lsquo;Such a reasonable
      connection!&rsquo; every body said; &lsquo;a military man of fine old
      family. It is really delightful to have a union sometimes take place in
      which all the conditions are satisfactory.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the time his miniature hung round my neck. Why? Because, in the
      bottom of my soul, I still believed him. I had heard him say, So help me
      God!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went away, and sometimes returned for a week. I was comforted by
      seeing that he did not love your mother, and by the confidence I had that
      she would not marry him. I was sure that something would happen to
      prevent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The year was coming round. One night your mother appeared in my
      room in her night-dress; her face was radiant, and she held a note in her
      hand. It was from her lover. He had thrown himself upon a ship when her
      letter reached him, and here he was close at hand. Full of generous ardor,
      he proposed to marry her privately at once; there was no other way, he was
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Will you help us?&rsquo; she said, after she had told me
      every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But you are two such children,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then you will not help. You will make me marry Colonel
      Wayne.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to see the matter calmly. I sought the succor of God. I do
      not say that I did just what I should have done, but I helped them. The
      heart is weak, and perhaps I was the more willing to help, because the
      fulfillment of her plan would prevent her becoming the wife of Colonel
      Wayne. The time was arranged when she was to go away. I was to accompany
      her, and she was to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lover came. It was a June night; the moon was full. We went
      quietly along the avenue. The gate was opened. We were just passing
      through when your grandfather and Colonel Wayne suddenly stepped from the
      shadow of the wall and the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother and her lover stood perfectly still. She gave a little
      cry. Your grandfather was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go, Sir!&rsquo; he shrieked at the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If your daughter commands it,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandfather seized him involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, my daughter is the betrothed wife of Colonel Wayne.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man looked with an incredulous smile at your mother, who
      had sunk senseless into my arms, and said, in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She was mine before she ever saw him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandfather actually hissed at him with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go&mdash;before I strike you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man hesitated for a few moments, saw that it was useless
      to remain longer at that time, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day Mr. Burt sent for Dr. Peewee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment I knew what he intended to do I ran to your grandfather
      and told him that Colonel Wayne was not a fit husband for his daughter.
      But when I told him that the Colonel had deserted me, Mr. Burt laughed
      scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You, Mrs. Simcoe? Why, you have lost your wits. Remember,
      Colonel Wayne is a gentleman of the oldest family, and you are&mdash;you
      were&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I was a poor country girl,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and Colonel
      Wayne loved me, and I loved him, and here is the pledge and proof of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drew out his miniature as I spoke, and held it before your
      grandfather&rsquo;s eyes. He fairly staggered, and rang the bell
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Call Colonel Wayne,&rsquo; he said, hastily, to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment the Colonel came in. I saw his color change as his eye
      fell upon me, holding the locket in my hand, and upon your grandfather&rsquo;s
      flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Colonel Wayne, have you ever seen Mrs. Simcoe before?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very pale, and there were sallow circles under his eyes as
      he spoke; but he said, calmly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not to my knowledge.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scorn made me icily calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who gave me that, Sir?&rsquo; said I, thrusting the
      miniature almost into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took it in his hand and looked at it. I saw his lip work and his
      throat quiver with an involuntary spasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am sure I do not know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was speechless. Your grandfather was confounded. Colonel Wayne
      looked white, but resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;God only is my witness,&rsquo; said I, slowly, as if the
      words came gasping from my heart. &lsquo;So help me God, I loved him, and
      he loved me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quiver ran through his frame as I spoke, but he preserved the
      same placidity of face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There is some mistake, Mrs. Simcoe,&rsquo; said your
      grandfather, not unkindly, to me. &lsquo;Go to your room.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obeyed, for my duty was done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe paused, and rocked silently to and fro. Hope took her hand and
      kissed it reverently. Presently the narration was quietly resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told your mother my story. But she was stunned by her own grief,
      and I do not think she comprehended me. Dr. Peewee came, and she was
      married. Your mother did not say yes&mdash;for she could not utter a word&mdash;but
      the ceremony proceeded. I heard the words, &lsquo;Whom God hath joined
      together,&rsquo; and I laughed aloud, and fell fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a few days after the marriage, when Colonel Wayne and his
      wife were absent, that your grandfather said to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Simcoe, your story seems to be true. But think a
      moment. A man like Colonel Wayne must have had many experiences. We all
      do. He has been rash, and foolish, and thoughtless, I have no doubt. He
      may even have trifled with your feelings. I am very sorry. If he has done
      so, I think he ought to have acknowledged it the other day. But I hope
      sincerely that we shall all let by-gones be by-gones, and live happily
      together. Ah! I see dinner is ready. Good-day, Mrs. Simcoe. Dr. Peewee,
      will you ask a blessing?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already midnight, and the two women sat before the fire. It was the
      moment when Abel Newt was stealing through his rooms, fastening doors and
      windows. Hope Wayne was pale and cold like a statue as she listened to the
      voice of Mrs. Simcoe, which had a wailing tone pitiful to hear. After a
      long silence she began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ought I to have done? Should I have gone away? That was the
      easiest course. But, Hope, the way of duty is not often the easiest way. I
      wrote a long letter to the good old Bishop Asbury, who seemed to me like a
      father, and after a while his answer came. He told me that I should seek
      the Lord&rsquo;s leading, and if that bade me stay&mdash;if that told me
      that it would be for my soul&rsquo;s blessing that my heart should break
      daily&mdash;then I had better remain, seeing that the end is not here&mdash;that
      here we have no continuing city, and that our proud hearts must be bruised
      by grief, even as our Saviour&rsquo;s lowly forehead was pierced with
      thorns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I staid. It was partly pity for your mother, who began to droop
      at once. It was partly that I might keep my wound bleeding for my soul&rsquo;s
      salvation; and partly&mdash;I see it now, but I could not then&mdash;because
      I believed, as before God I do now believe, that in his secret heart I was
      the woman your father loved, and I could not give him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s lover wrote to me at once, I discovered
      afterward, but his letters were intercepted, for your grandfather was a
      shrewd, resolute man. Then he came to Pinewood, but he was not allowed to
      see your mother. The poor boy was frantic; but before he could effect any
      thing your mother was the wife of Colonel Wayne. Then, in the same ship in
      which he had come from India, he returned; and after he was gone all his
      letters were given to me. I wrote to him at once. I told him every thing
      about your mother, but there was not much to tell. She never mentioned his
      name after her marriage. There were gay parties given in honor of the
      wedding, and her delicate, drooping, phantom-like figure hung upon the arm
      of her handsome, elegant husband. People said that her maidenly shyness
      was beautiful to behold, and that she clung to her husband like the waving
      ivy to the oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not cling long. She was just nineteen when she was married&mdash;she
      was not twenty when you were born&mdash;she was just twenty when they
      buried her. Oh! I did not think of myself only, but of her, when I heard
      the saintly youth breathe that plaintive prayer, &lsquo;Draw them to thee,
      for they wearily labor: they are heavily laden, gracious Father! oh, give
      them rest!&rsquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;&lsquo;No chilling winds or pois&rsquo;nous breath
     Can reach that healthful shore:
  Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
     Are felt and fear&rsquo;d no more.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my father?&rdquo; asked Hope, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went abroad for many years. Then he returned, and came sometimes
      to Pinewood. His life was irregular. I think he gambled, for he and your
      grandfather often had high words in the library about the money that he
      wanted. But your grandfather never allowed you to leave the place. He
      rarely spoke of your mother; but I think he often thought of her, and he
      gradually fell into the habit you remember. Yet he had the same ambition
      for you that he had had for your mother. He treated me always with stately
      politeness; but I know that it was a dreary home for a young girl. Hope,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Simcoe, after a short pause, &ldquo;that is all&mdash;the end
      you yourself remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hope, in the same low, appalled tone, &ldquo;my
      father went out upon the pond, one evening, with a friend to bathe, and
      was drowned. Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys found him. My grandfather would not let
      me wear mourning for him. I wore a blue ribbon the day Dr. Peewee preached
      his funeral sermon; and I did not care to wear black. Aunty, I had seen
      him too little to love him like a father, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it almost as if apologizing to Mrs. Simcoe, who merely bowed her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past midnight. It was the very moment when Abel Newt was starting
      with horror as he saw his own reflection in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something yet remained to be said between those two women. Each knew it&mdash;neither
      dared to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne closed her eyes with an inward prayer, and then said, calmly,
      but in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, aunty, the young man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simcoe took Hope&rsquo;s face between her caressing hands. She
      smoothed the glistening golden hair, and kissed her upon the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunty, the young man?&rdquo; said Hope, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Lawrence Newt,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Simcoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;It was the moment when Abel sat at his desk writing the name that
      Mrs. Simcoe had pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne was perfectly sure it was coming, and yet the word shot out
      upon her like a tongue of lightning. At first she felt every nerve in her
      frame relaxed&mdash;a mist clouded her eyes&mdash;she had a weary sense of
      happiness, for she thought she was dying. The mist passed. She felt her
      cheeks glowing, and was preternaturally calm. Mrs. Simcoe sat beside her,
      weeping silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, dearest aunty!&rdquo; said Hope, as she rose and bent
      down to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child!&rdquo; said the older woman, in tones that trembled out
      of an aching heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope took her candle, and moved toward the door. As she went she heard
      Mrs. Simcoe repeating, in the old murmuring sunset strain,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Convince us first of unbelief,
   And freely then release;
 Fill every soul with sacred grief,
   And then with sacred peace.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXVI. &mdash; A SOCIAL GLASS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Honorable Abel Newt was elected to Congress in place of the Honorable
      Watkins Bodley, who withdrew on account of the embarrassment of his
      private affairs. At a special meeting of the General Committee, Mr. Enos
      Slugby, Chairman of the Ward Committee, introduced a long and eloquent
      resolution, deploring the loss sustained by the city and by the whole
      country in the resignation of the Honorable Watkins Bodley&mdash;sympathizing
      with him in the perplexity of his private affairs&mdash;but rejoicing that
      the word &ldquo;close up!&rdquo; was always faithfully obeyed&mdash;that
      there was always a fresh soldier to fill the place of the retiring&mdash;and
      that the Party never summoned her sons in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch then rose and offered a resolution:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Resolved&mdash;</i>That in the Honorable Abel Newt, our
      representative, just elected by a triumphant majority of the votes of the
      enlightened and independent voters of the district&mdash;a constituency of
      whose favor the most experienced and illustrious statesmen might be proud&mdash;we
      recognize a worthy exemplar of the purest republican virtues, a consistent
      enemy of a purse-proud aristocracy, the equally unflinching friend of the
      people; a man who dedicates with enthusiasm the rare powers of his youth,
      and his profoundest and sincerest convictions, to the great cause of
      popular rights of which the Party is the exponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>&mdash;That the Honorable Abel Newt be requested, at
      the earliest possible moment, to unfold to his fellow-citizens his views
      upon State and National political affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. William Condor spoke feelingly in support of the resolutions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow-citizens!&rdquo; he said, eloquently, in conclusion, &ldquo;if
      there is one thing nobler than another, it is an upright, downright,
      disinterested, honest man. Such I am proud and happy to declare my friend,
      your friend, the friend of all honest men, to be; and I call for three
      cheers for Honest Abel Newt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were given with ardor; and then General Belch was called out for a
      few remarks, &ldquo;which he delivered,&rdquo; said the <i>Evening Banner
      of the Union</i>, &ldquo;with his accustomed humor, keeping the audience
      in a roar of laughter, and sending every body happy to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee-meeting was over, and the spectators retired to the
      neighboring bar-rooms. Mr. Slugby, Mr. Condor, and General Belch tarried
      behind, with two or three more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go to Newt&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I told him we should be round after the meeting,&rdquo;
      replied Mr. Condor; and the party were presently at his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Abel had placed several full decanters upon the table, with
      a box of cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt,&rdquo; said Enos Slugby, after they had been smoking and
      drinking for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an uncle, have you not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very eminent merchant, I believe. His name is very well known,
      and he commands great respect. Ahem!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slugby cleared his throat; then continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will naturally be very much interested in the career and success
      of his nephew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, immensely!&rdquo; replied Abel, in a thick voice, and with a
      look and tone which suggested to his friends that he was rapidly priming
      himself. &ldquo;Immensely, enormously!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Slugby, with an air of curious meditation.
      &ldquo;I do not remember to have heard the character of his political
      proclivities mentioned. But, of course, as the brother of Boniface Newt
      and the uncle of the Honorable Abel Newt&rdquo;&mdash;here Mr. Slugby
      bowed to that gentleman, who winked at him over the rim of his glass&mdash;&ldquo;he
      is naturally a friend of the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you said he was very fond of you?&rdquo; added Mr. Slugby,
      while his friends looked expectantly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fond? It&rsquo;s a clear case of apple of the eye,&rdquo; answered
      Abel, chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said William Condor; &ldquo;very good, indeed!
      Capital!&rdquo; laughed Belch; and whispered to his neighbor Condor,
      &ldquo;In vino veritas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they whispered, and smiled, and nodded together, Abel Newt glanced
      around the circle with sullen, fiery eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Lawrence is worth a million of dollars,&rdquo; said he,
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group of political gentlemen shook their heads in silent admiration.
      They seemed to themselves to have struck a golden vein, and General Belch
      could not help inwardly complimenting himself upon his profound sagacity
      in having put forward a candidate who had a bachelor uncle who doated upon
      him, and who was worth a million. He perceived at once his own increased
      importance in the Party. To have displaced Watkins Bodley&mdash;who was
      not only an uncertain party implement, but poor&mdash;by an unhesitating
      young man of great ability and of enormous prospects, he knew was to have
      secured for himself whatever he chose to ask. The fat nose reddened and
      glistened as if it would burst with triumph and joy. General Arcularius
      Belch was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said William Condor, &ldquo;a man of Mr. Lawrence
      Newt&rsquo;s experience and knowledge of the world is aware that there are
      certain necessary expenses attendant upon elections&mdash;such as
      printing, rent, lighting, warming, posting, etc.&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, sundries,&rdquo; said Abel, smiling with the black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, precisely; sundries,&rdquo; answered Mr. Condor, &ldquo;which
      sometimes swell to quite an inordinate figure. Your uncle, I presume, Mr.
      Newt, would not be unwilling to contribute a certain share of the expense
      of your election; and indeed, now that you are so conspicuous a leader, he
      would probably expect to contribute handsomely to the current expenses of
      the Party. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Enos Slugby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; echoed the two or three other gentlemen who sat
      silently, assiduously smoking and drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, clearly, of course,&rdquo; answered Abel, still thickly, and in
      a tone by no means agreeable to his companions. &ldquo;What should you
      consider to be his fair share?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Condor, &ldquo;I should think, in ordinary
      times, a thousand a year; and then, as particular occasion demands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this distinct little speech the whole company lifted their glasses that
      they might more conveniently watch Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a half-maudlin grin he looked along the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-by, Condor, how much do you give a year?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit, by G&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; energetically said one of the
      silent men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for Newt!&rdquo; cried General Belch, thumping the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another little burst of laughter, with the least possible
      merriment in it. William Condor joined with an entirely unruffled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Belch,&rdquo; continued Abel, with what would be called in
      animals an ugly expression&mdash;&ldquo;Belch is the clown, and they left
      him off easy. The Party is like the old kings, it keeps a good many fools
      to make it laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was threatening, and nobody laughed. General Belch looked as if
      he were restraining himself from knocking his friend down. But they all
      saw that their host was mastered by his own liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squeeze Lawrence Newt, will you? Why, Lord, gentlemen, what do you
      suppose he thinks of you&mdash;I mean, of fellows like you?&rdquo; asked
      Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and glared around him. William Condor daintily knocked off the
      ash of his cigar faith the tip of his little finger, and said, calmly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor care,&rdquo; said General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks you&rsquo;re all a set of white-livered sneaks!&rdquo;
      shouted Abel, in a voice harsh and hoarse with liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen were silent. The leaders wagged their feet nervously; the
      others looked rather amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offense,&rdquo; resumed Abel. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean he
      despises you in particular, but all bar-room bobtails.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice thickened rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all mean, mis-mis-rabble hounds, he thinks you are the dirt-est.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no reply was made. The honorable gentleman looked at his guests
      leeringly, but found no responsive glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In vino veritas,&rdquo; whispered Condor to his neighbor Belch.
      William Condor was always clean in linen and calm in manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be &lsquo;larmed, fel-fel-f&rsquo;-low cit-zens!
      Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s no friend of mine. I guess his G&mdash;&mdash; d&mdash;&mdash;
      pride &lsquo;ll get a tumble some day; by G&mdash;&mdash; I do!&rdquo;
      Abel added, with a fierce hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests looked alarmed as they heard the last words. Abel ceased, and
      passed the decanter, which they did not decline; for they all felt as if
      the Honorable Abel Newt would probably throw it at the head of any man who
      said or did what he did not approve. There was a low anxious murmur of
      conversation among them until Abel was evidently very intoxicated, and his
      head sank upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly afraid we&rsquo;ve burned our fingers,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Enos Slugby, looking a little ruefully at the honorable
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not,&rdquo; said General Belch; &ldquo;but there may be
      some breakers ahead. If we lose the Grant it won&rsquo;t be the first
      cause or man that has been betrayed by the bottle. Condor, let me fill
      your glass. It is clear that if our dear friend Newt has a weakness it is
      the bottle; and if our enemies at Washington, who want to head off this
      Grant, have a strength, it is finding out an adversary&rsquo;s soft spot.
      We may find in this case that it&rsquo;s dangerous playing with edged
      tools. But I&rsquo;ve great faith in his want of principle. We can show
      him so clearly that his interest, his advance, his career depend so
      entirely upon his conduct, that I think we can keep him straight. And, for
      my part, if we can only work this Grant through, I shall retire upon my
      share of the proceeds, and leave politics to those who love &lsquo;em. But
      I don&rsquo;t mean to have worked for nothing&mdash;hey, Condor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; replied William, placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-by, Condor,&rdquo; said Mr. Enos Slugby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Condor turned toward him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Jim say t&rsquo;other day&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Jim?&rdquo; asked Condor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; returned Slugby, &ldquo;Jim&mdash;why, Jim&rsquo;s the
      party in my district.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;yes; I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Condor; &ldquo;the name
      had escaped me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I heard Jim say t&rsquo;other day that Mr. William Condor was
      getting too d&mdash;&mdash;d stuck up, and that he&rsquo;d yank him out of
      his office if he didn&rsquo;t mind his eye. That&rsquo;s you, Condor; so I
      advise you to look out. It&rsquo;s easy enough to manage Jim, if you take
      care. He&rsquo;ll go as gently as a well-broke filly; but if he once takes
      a lurch&mdash;if he thinks you&rsquo;re too 'proud&rsquo; or &lsquo;big,&rsquo;
      it&rsquo;s all up with you. So mind how you treat Jim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Belch, impatiently; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
      other business on hand now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Condor; &ldquo;we are the Honorable Abel&rsquo;s
      Jim. Turn about is fair play. Jim makes us go; we make Abel go. It&rsquo;s
      a lovely series of checks and balances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it so quietly and airily that they all laughed. Then the General
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to send Newt to look after Ele, and I rather
      think we shall have to send somebody to look after Newt. However, we&rsquo;ll
      see. Let&rsquo;s leave this hog to snore by himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were the words of your resolution, Belch?&rdquo; asked William
      Condor, with his eyes twinkling. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite remember. Did
      you say,&rdquo; he added, looking at Abel, who lay huddled, dead drunk, in
      his chair, &ldquo;that he dedicated to his country his profoundest and
      sincerest, or sincerest and profoundest convictions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Condor,&rdquo; said Enos Slugby, smiling, as he lighted a
      fresh cigar, &ldquo;did you say that you were proud and happy, or happy
      and proud, to call him your friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! Lord! what an old hum it is&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
      General Belch, cheerfully, as he smoothed his hat with his coat-sleeve,
      and put it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down stairs laughing and chatting; and the Honorable Abel Newt,
      the worthy exemplar of the purest republican virtues&mdash;as the
      resolution stated when it appeared in the next morning&rsquo;s papers&mdash;was
      left snoring amidst his constituency of empty decanters and drained
      glasses.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXVII. &mdash; FACE TO FACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signore Pittore! what brings a bird into the barn-yard?&rdquo; said
      Lawrence Newt, as Arthur Merlin entered his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hope of some crumb of comfort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dip from your empyrean to the cold earth&mdash;from the
      studio to a counting-room&mdash;to find comfort?&rdquo; asked Lawrence
      Newt, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin looked only half sympathetic with his friend&rsquo;s gayety.
      There was a wan air on his face, a piteous look in his eyes, which touched
      Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Arthur, what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember what Diana said?&rdquo; replied the painter.
      &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I am sure that that silly shepherd will not sleep
      there forever. Never fear, he will wake up. Diana never looks or loves for
      nothing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt gazed at him without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Arthur, with a feeble effort at fun, &ldquo;you
      have correspondence all over the world. What is the news from Latmos? Has
      the silly shepherd waked up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Arthur,&rdquo; said Mr. Newt, gravely, &ldquo;I told you
      long ago that he was dead to all that heavenly splendor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men gazed steadfastly at each other without speaking. At length
      Arthur said, in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lawrence Newt spoke the word the air far off and near seemed to him to
      ring again with that pervasive murmur, sad, soft, infinitely tender,
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Newt, good-by!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But his eye was calm and his face cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man seated himself, and the older one drawing a chair to the
      window, they sat with their backs to the outer office and looked upon the
      ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am older than you, Arthur, and I am your friend. What I am going
      to say to you I have no right to say, except in your entire friendship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s eyes glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I first knew you I knew that you loved Hope Wayne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush deepened upon Arthur&rsquo;s face, and his fingers played idly
      upon the arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped that Hope Wayne would love you. I was sure that she would.
      It never occurred to me that she could&mdash;could&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could love any body else,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, as his eyes
      wandered dreamily among the vessels, as if the canvas were the wings of
      his memory sailing far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly, without the least suspicion on my part, I discovered that
      she did love somebody else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;so did I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I do?&rdquo; said the other, still abstractedly gazing;
      &ldquo;for I loved her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You loved her?&rdquo; cried Arthur Merlin, so suddenly and loud
      that Thomas Tray looked up from his great red Russia book and turned his
      head toward the inner office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I loved her,&rdquo; replied Lawrence Newt, calmly, and
      with tender sweetness; &ldquo;and I had a right to, for I loved her
      mother. Could I have had my way Hope Wayne&rsquo;s mother would have been
      my wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin stole a glance at the face of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a child and she was a child&mdash;a boy and a girl. It was
      not to be. She married another man and died; but her memory is forever
      sacred to me, and so is her daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this astonishing revelation Arthur Merlin said nothing. His fingers
      still played idly on the chair, and his eyes, like the eyes of Lawrence,
      looked out upon the river. Every thing in Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s conduct
      was at once explained; and the poor artist was ready to curse his absurd
      folly in making his friend involuntarily sit for Endymion. Lawrence Newt
      knew his friend&rsquo;s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice, &ldquo;did I not say that,
      if Endymion were not dead, it would be impossible not to awake and love
      her? Do you not see that I was dead to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does she know it?&rdquo; asked the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she does now,&rdquo; was the slow answer. &ldquo;But she
      has not known it long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Amy Waring know it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Lawrence Newt, quietly, &ldquo;but she will
      to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men sat silently together for some time. The junior partner came
      in, spoke to Arthur, wrote a little, and went out again. Thomas Tray
      glanced up occasionally from his great volume, and the melancholy eyes of
      Little Malacca scarcely turned from the two figures which he watched from
      his desk through the office windows. Venables was promoted to be second to
      Thomas Tray on the very day that Gabriel was admitted a junior partner.
      They were all aware that the head of the house was engaged in some deeply
      interesting conversation, and they learned from Little Malacca who the
      stranger was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men sat silently together, Lawrence Newt evidently tranquilly
      waiting, Arthur Merlin vainly trying to say something further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; he began, at length, and stopped. A painful
      expression of doubt clouded his face; but Lawrence turned to him
      cheerfully, and said, in a frank, assuring tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, speak out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the artist, with almost a girl&rsquo;s shyness in
      his whole manner, &ldquo;before you, at least, I can speak, and am not
      ashamed. I want to know whether&mdash;you&mdash;think&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke very slowly, and stopped again. Before he resumed he saw Lawrence
      Newt shake his head negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what?&rdquo; asked Arthur, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe she ever will,&rdquo; replied the other, as if the
      artist had asked a question with his eyes. He spoke in a very low, serious
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will what?&rdquo; asked Arthur, his face burning with a bright
      crimson flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt waited a moment to give his friend time to recover, before
      he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I say what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur also waited for a little while; then he said, sadly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s no matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have grown older as he sat looking from the window. His hands
      idly played no longer, but rested quietly upon the chair. He shook his
      head slowly, and repeated, in a tone that touched his friend to the heart,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;it&rsquo;s no matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Arthur, it&rsquo;s only my opinion,&rdquo; said the other,
      kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine too,&rdquo; replied the artist, with an inexpressible
      sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt was silent. After a few moments Arthur Merlin rose and shook
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shall meet to-night.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXVIII. &mdash; FINISHING PICTURES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin returned to his studio and carefully locked the door. Then
      he opened a huge port-folio, which was full of sketches&mdash;and they
      were all of the same subject, treated in a hundred ways&mdash;they were
      all Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes it was a lady leaning from an oriel window in a medieval tower,
      listening in the moonlight, with love in her eyes and attitude, to the
      music of a guitar, touched by a gallant knight below, who looked as Arthur
      Merlin would have looked had Arthur Merlin been a gallant medieval knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was Juliet, pale and unconscious in the tomb; superb in snow-white
      drapery; pure as an angel, lovely as a woman; but it was Hope Wayne still&mdash;and
      Romeo stole frightened in, but Romeo was Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or it was Beatrice moving in a radiant heaven; while far below, kneeling,
      and with clasped hands, gazing upward, the melancholy Dante watched the
      vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or the fair phantom of Goethe&rsquo;s ballad looked out with humid,
      passionate glances between the clustering reeds she pushed aside, and
      lured the fisherman with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were scores of such sketches, from romance, and history, and fancy,
      and in each the beauty was Hope Wayne&rsquo;s; and it was strange to see
      that in each, however different from all the others, there was still a
      charm characteristic of the woman he loved; so that it seemed a vivid
      record of all the impressions she had made upon him, and as if all
      heroines of poetry or history were only ladies in waiting upon her. In all
      of them, too, there was a separation between them. She was remote in
      sphere or in space; there was the feeling of inaccessibility between them
      in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned them slowly over, and gazed at them as earnestly as if his
      glance could make that beauty live, he suddenly perceived, what he had
      never before felt, that the instinct which had unconsciously given the
      same character of hopelessness to the incident of the sketches was the
      same that had made him so readily acquiesce in what Lawrence Newt had
      hinted. He paused at a drawing of Pygmalion and his statue. The same
      instinct had selected the moment before the sculptor&rsquo;s prayer was
      granted; when he looks at the immovable beauty of his statue with the
      yearning love that made the marble live. But the statue of Arthur&rsquo;s
      Pygmalion would never live. It was a statue only, and forever. He asked
      himself why he had not selected the moment when she falls breathing and
      blushing into the sculptor&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in his studio the artist blushed, as if the very thought were wrong;
      and he felt that he had never really dared to hope, however he had longed,
      and wished, and flattered his fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at each one of the drawings carefully and long, then kissed it
      and turned it upon its face. When he had seen them all he sat for a
      moment; then quietly tore them into long strips, then into small pieces;
      and, lifting the window, scattered them upon the air. The wind whirled
      them over the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a pretty snow-storm!&rdquo; said the little street
      children, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Arthur Merlin turned to his great easel, upon which stood the canvas
      of the picture of Diana and Endymion. Through the parted clouds the face
      of the Queen and huntress&mdash;the face of Hope Wayne&mdash;looked
      tenderly upon the sleeping figure of the shepherd on the bare top of the
      grassy hill&mdash;the face and figure of Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter took his brushes and his pallet, and his maulstick. He paused
      for some time again, as he stood before the easel, then he went quietly to
      work. He touched it here and there. He stepped back to mark the effect&mdash;rubbed
      with his finger&mdash;sighed&mdash;stepped back&mdash;and still worked on.
      The hours glided away, and daylight began to fade, but not until he had
      finished his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he scraped his pallet and washed his brushes, and seated himself upon
      the sofa opposite the easel. There was no picture, of Diana or of Endymion
      any longer. In the place of Diana there was a full summer moon shining
      calmly in a cloudless heaven. Its benignant light fell upon a solitary
      grave upon a hill-top, which filled the spot where Endymion had lain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin sat in the corner of the sofa with folded arms, looking at
      the picture, until the darkness entirely hid it from view.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXIX. &mdash; THE LAST THROW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Arthur and Lawrence were conversing in the office of the latter,
      Abel Newt, hat in hand, stood in Hope Wayne&rsquo;s parlor. His hair was
      thinner and grizzled; his face bloated, and his eyes dull. His hands had
      that dead, chalky color in which appetite openly paints its excesses. The
      hand trembled as it held the hat; and as the man stood before the mirror,
      he was straining his eyes at his own reflection, and by some secret magic
      he saw, as if dimly traced beside it, the figure of the boy that stood in
      the parlor of Pinewood&mdash;how many thousand years ago?
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a step, and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne stopped, leaving the door open, bowed, and looked inquiringly
      at him. She was dressed simply in a morning dress, and her golden hair
      clustered and curled around the fresh beauty of her face&mdash;the rose of
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wish to say something to me?&rdquo; she asked, observing
      that Abel merely stared at her stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was as cold and remote as if she were a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt was evidently abashed by the reception. But he moved toward her,
      and began in a tone of doubtful familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hope, I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Newt, you have no right to address me in that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wayne, I have come to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, embarrassed, rubbing his fingers upon the palms of his hands.
      She looked at him steadily. He waited a few moments, then began again in a
      hurried tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wayne, we are both older than we once were; and once, I think,
      we were not altogether indifferent to each other. Time has taught us many
      things. I find that my heart, after foolish wanderings, is still true to
      its first devotion. We can both view things more calmly, not less truly,
      however, than we once did. I am upon the eve of a public career. I have
      outgrown morbid emotions, and I come to ask you if you would take time to
      reflect whether I might not renew my addresses; for indeed I love, and can
      love, no other woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne stood pale, incredulous, and confounded while Abel Newt, with
      some of the old fire in the eye and the old sweetness in the voice, poured
      out these rapid words, and advanced toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Sir,&rdquo; she said, as soon as she could command herself.
      &ldquo;Is this all you have to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drive me to despair,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, in
      reply, and so fiercely that Hope Wayne started. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; He
      spoke with stern command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am utterly ruined. I have no friends. I have bad habits. You can
      save me&mdash;will you do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope stood before him silent. His hard black eye was fixed upon her with a
      kind of defying appeal for help. Her state of mind for some days, since
      she had heard Mrs. Simcoe&rsquo;s story, had been one of curious mental
      tension. She was inspired by a sense of renunciation&mdash;of
      self-sacrifice. It seemed to her that some great work to do, something
      which should occupy every moment, and all her powers and thoughts, was her
      only hope of contentment. What it might be, what it ought to be, she had
      not conceived. Was it not offered now? Horrible, repulsive, degrading&mdash;yes,
      but was it not so much the worthier? Here stood the man she had loved in
      all the prime and power of his youth, full of hope, and beauty, and vigor&mdash;the
      hero that satisfied the girl&rsquo;s longing&mdash;and he was bent, gray,
      wan, shaking, utterly lost, except for her. Should she restore him to that
      lost manhood? Could she forgive herself if she suffered her own feelings,
      tastes, pride, to prevent?
    </p>
    <p>
      While the thought whirled through her excited brain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he said, solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;remember it is the
      salvation of a human soul upon which you are deciding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was perfect silence for some minutes. The low, quick ticking of the
      clock upon the mantle was all they heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have decided,&rdquo; she said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you knew it would be,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you refuse?&rdquo; he said, in a half-threatening tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the damnation of a soul rest upon your head forever,&rdquo; he
      said, in a loud coarse voice, crushing his hat, and his black eyes
      glaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done?&rdquo; she asked, pale and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hope Wayne, I have not done; I am not deceived by your smooth
      face and your quiet eyes. I have known long enough that you meant to marry
      my Uncle Lawrence, although he is old enough to be your father. The whole
      world has known it and seen it. And I came to give you a chance of saving
      your name by showing to the world that my uncle came here familiarly
      because you were to marry his nephew. You refuse the chance. There was a
      time when you would have flown into my arms, and now you reject me ... And
      I shall have my revenge! I warn you to beware, Mrs. Lawrence Newt! I warn
      you that my saintly uncle is not beyond misfortune, nor his milksop
      partner, the Reverend Gabriel Bennet. I am a man at bay; and it is you who
      put me there; you who might save me and won&rsquo;t. You who will one day
      remember and suffer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw up his arms in uncontrollable rage and excitement. His thick
      hoarse voice, his burning, bad, black eyes, his quivering hands, his
      bloated body, made him a terrible spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done?&rdquo; asked Hope Wayne, with saintly dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have done for this time,&rdquo; he hissed; &ldquo;but I
      shall cross you many a time. You and yours,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;but
      never so that you can harm me. You shall feel, but never see me. You have
      left me nothing but despair. And the doom of my soul be upon yours!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed from the room, and Hope Wayne stood speechless. Attracted by the
      loud tone of his voice, Mrs. Simcoe had come down stairs, and the moment
      he was gone she was by Hope&rsquo;s side. They seated themselves together
      upon the sofa, and Hope leaned her head upon her aunty&rsquo;s shoulder
      and wept with utter surprise, grief, indignation, and weariness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXX. &mdash; CLOUDS BREAKING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Amy Waring came to Hope Wayne radiant with the prospect
      of her Aunt Martha&rsquo;s restoration to the world. Hope shook her hand
      warmly, and looked into her friend&rsquo;s illuminated face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is engaged to Lawrence Newt,&rdquo; said Hope, in her heart, as
      she kissed Amy&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Amy!&rdquo; she added, with so much earnestness that
      Amy looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; said Hope, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you know about it?&rdquo; asked Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am blind?&rdquo; said Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but no eyes could see it, it was so hidden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be hidden,&rdquo; said Hope, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy stopped, looked inquiringly at her friend, and blushed&mdash;wondering
      what she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Hope, at least we are hiding from each other. I came to ask
      you to a family festival.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; answered Hope, with an air of quiet knowledge,
      and not at all surprised. Amy Waring was confused, she hardly knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hope, I mean only that Lawrence Newt&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne smiled so tenderly and calmly, and with such tranquil
      consciousness that she knew every thing Amy was about to say, that Amy
      stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Hope, placidly; &ldquo;I want to hear it from
      your own lips.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring was in doubt no longer. She knew that Hope expected to hear
      that she was engaged. And not with less placidity than Hope&rsquo;s, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence Newt wants us all to come and dine with him, because my
      Aunt Martha is found, and he wishes to bring Aunt Bennet and her together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. Hope looked as confusedly at the calm Amy as Amy, a moment
      since, had looked at her. Then they both smiled, for they had, perhaps,
      some vague idea of what each had been thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening the Round Table met. Arthur Merlin came early&mdash;so
      did Hope Wayne. They sat together talking rapidly, but Hope did not escape
      observing the unusual sadness of the artist&mdash;a sadness of manner
      rather than of expression. In a thousand ways there was a deference in his
      treatment of her which was unusual and touching. She had been very sure
      that he had understood what she meant when she spoke to him with an air of
      badinage about his picture. And certainly it was plain enough. It was
      clear enough; only he would not see what was before his eyes, nor hear
      what was in his ears, and so had to grope a little further until Lawrence
      Newt suddenly struck a light and showed him where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were yet talking Lawrence Newt came in. He spoke to Amy Waring,
      and then went straight up to Hope Wayne and put out his hand with the old
      frank smile breaking over his face. She rose and answered his smile, and
      laid her hand in his. They looked in each other&rsquo;s eyes; and Lawrence
      Newt saw in Hope Wayne&rsquo;s the beauty of a girl that long ago, as a
      boy, he had loved; and in his own, Hope felt that tenderness which had
      made her mother&rsquo;s happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a moment. It was but a word. For the first time he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the first time she answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring heard them. The two words seemed sharp: they pierced her heart,
      and she felt faint. The room swam, but she bit her lip till the blood
      came, and her stout heart preserved her from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what I knew: they are engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But how was it that the manner of Lawrence Newt toward herself was never
      before more loyal and devoted? How was it that the quiet hilarity of the
      morning was not gone, but stole into his conversation with her so
      pointedly that she could not help feeling that it magnetized her, and
      that, against her will, she was more than ever cheerful? How was it that
      she knew it was herself who helped make that hilarity&mdash;that it was
      not only her friend Hope who inspired it?
    </p>
    <p>
      They are secrets not to be told. But as they all sat around the table, and
      Arthur Merlin for the first time insisted upon reading from Byron, and in
      his rich melancholy voice recited
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though the day of my destiny&rsquo;s over,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that the cloud had lifted&mdash;that the spell of constraint
      was removed; and yet none of them precisely understood why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt as they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; echoed Amy Waring and Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Merlin pulled his cap over his eyes and sauntered slowly homeward,
      whistling musingly, and murmuring,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bird in the wilderness singing, That speaks to my spirit of thee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His Aunt Winnifred heard him as he came in. The good old lady had placed a
      fresh tract where he would be sure to see it when he entered his room. She
      heard his cautious step stealing up stairs, for the painter was careful to
      make no noise; and as she listened she drew pictures upon her fancy of the
      scenes in which her boy had been mingling. It was Aunt Winnifred&rsquo;s
      firm conviction that society&mdash;that is, the great world of which she
      knew nothing&mdash;languished for the smile and presence of her nephew,
      Arthur. That very evening her gossip, Mrs. Toxer, had been in, and Aunt
      Winnifred had discussed her favorite theme until Mrs. Toxer went home with
      a vague idea that all the young and beautiful unmarried women in the city
      were secretly pining away for love of Arthur Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy me, now!&rdquo; said Aunt Winnifred as she lay listening to
      the creaking step of her nephew. &ldquo;I wonder what poor girl&rsquo;s
      heart that wicked boy has been breaking to-night;&rdquo; and she turned
      over and fell asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      That young man reached his room, and struck a light. It flashed upon a
      paper. He took it up eagerly, then smiled as he saw that it was a tract,
      and read, &ldquo;A word to the Unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Aunt Winnifred!&rdquo; said he to himself; &ldquo;does she
      think a man&rsquo;s griefs are like a child&rsquo;s bumps and bruises, to
      be cured by applying a piece of paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled sadly, with the profound conviction that no man had ever before
      really known what unhappiness was, and so tumbled into bed and fell
      asleep. And as he dreamed, Hope Wayne came to him and smiled, as Diana
      smiled in his picture upon Endymion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I love you; look here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in his dream he looked and saw a full moon in a summer sky shining
      upon a fresh grave upon a hill-top.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXI. &mdash; MRS. ALFRED DINKS AT HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A new element had forced itself into the life of Hope Wayne, and that was
      the fate of Abel Newt. There was something startling in the direct,
      passionate, personal appeal he had made to her. She put on her bonnet and
      furs, for it was Christmas time, and passed the Bowery into the small,
      narrow street where the smell of the sewer was the chief odor and the few
      miserable trees cooped up in perforated boxes had at last been released
      from suffering, and were placidly, rigidly dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sloppy servant girl was standing upon the area steps with her apron
      over her head, and blowing her huge red fingers, staring at every thing,
      and apparently stunned when Hope Wayne stopped and went up the steps. Hope
      rang, entered the little parlor and seated herself upon the haircloth
      sofa. Her heart ached with the dreariness of the house; but while she was
      resolving that she would certainly raise her secret allowance to her
      Cousin Alfred, whether her good friend Lawrence Newt approved of it or
      not, she saw that the dreariness was not in the small room or the hair
      sofa, nor in the two lamps with glass drops upon the mantle, but in the
      lack of that indescribable touch of feminine taste, and tact, and
      tenderness, which create comfort and grace wherever they fall, and make
      the most desolate chambers to blossom with cheerfulness. Hope felt as she
      glanced around her that money could not buy what was wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Alfred Dinks presently entered. Hope Wayne had rarely met her since
      the season at Saratoga when Fanny had captured her prize. She saw that the
      black-eyed, clever, resolute girl of those days had grown larger and more
      pulpy, and was wrapped in a dingy morning wrapper. Her hair was not
      smooth, her hands were not especially clean; she had that dull
      carelessness, or unconsciousness of personal appearance, which seemed to
      Hope only the parlor aspect of the dowdiness that had run entirely to seed
      in the sloppy servant girl upon the area steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne put out her hand, which Fanny listlessly took. There was
      nothing very hard, or ferocious, or defiant in her manner, as Hope had
      expected&mdash;there was only a weariness and indifference, as if she had
      been worsted in some kind of struggle. She did not even seem to be excited
      by seeing Hope Wayne in her house, but merely said, &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo;
      and then sank quietly upon the sofa, as if she had said every thing she
      had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to ask you if you know any thing about Abel?&rdquo; said
      Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nothing in particular,&rdquo; replied Fanny; &ldquo;I believe
      he&rsquo;s going to Congress; but I never see him or hear of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Alfred see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He used to meet him at Thiel&rsquo;s; but Alfred doesn&rsquo;t go
      there much now. It&rsquo;s too fine for poor gentlemen. I remember some
      time ago I saw he had a black eye, and he said that he and my &lsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;
      brother Abel,&rsquo; as he elegantly expressed it, had met somewhere the
      night before, and Abel was drunk and gave him the lie, and they fought it
      out. I think, by-the-way, that&rsquo;s the last I&rsquo;ve heard of
      brother Abel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight touch of the old manner in the tone with which Fanny
      ended her remark; after which she relapsed into the previous
      half-apathetic condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny, I wish I could do something for Abel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Dinks looked at Hope Wayne with an incredulous smile, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought once you would marry him; and so did he, I fancy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he do? and how can I reach him?&rdquo; asked Hope,
      entirely disregarding Fanny&rsquo;s remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives at the old place in Grand Street, I believe; the Lord
      knows how; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t. I suppose he gambles when he isn&rsquo;t
      drunk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about Congress?&rdquo; inquired Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any thing about that. Abel and father used to
      say that no gentleman would ever have any thing to do with politics; so I
      never heard any thing, and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s
      going to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny apparently supposed her last remark would end the conversation. Not
      that she wished to end it&mdash;not that she was sorry to see Hope Wayne
      again and to talk with her&mdash;not that she wanted or cared for any
      thing in particular, no, not even for her lord and master, who burst into
      the room with an oath, as usual, and with his small, swinish eyes heavy
      with drowsiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the house was evidently just down. He wore a dirty
      morning-gown, and slippers down at the heel, displaying his dirty
      stockings. He came in yawning and squeezing his eves together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the h&mdash;&mdash; don&rsquo;t that slut of a waiter have my
      coffee ready?&rdquo; he said to his wife, who paid no more attention to
      him than to the lamp on the mantle, but, on the contrary, appeared to Hope
      to be a little more indifferent than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, why the h&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Dinks began again, and
      had advanced so far when he suddenly saw his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! what are you doing here?&rdquo; he said to her abruptly, and
      in the half-sycophantic, half-bullying tone that indicates the feeling of
      such a man toward a person to whom he is under immense obligation. Alfred
      Dinks&rsquo;s real feeling was that Hope Wayne ought to give him a much
      larger allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope was inexpressibly disgusted; but she found an excitement in
      encountering this boorishness, which served to stimulate her in the
      struggle going on in her own soul. And she very soon understood how the
      sharp, sparkling, audacious Fanny Newt had become the inert, indifferent
      woman before her. A clever villain might have developed her, through
      admiration and sympathy, into villainy; but a dull, heavy brute merely
      crushed her. There is a spur in the prick of a rapier; only stupidity
      follows the blow of a club.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sitting silently for some minutes, during which Alfred Dinks
      sprawled in a chair, and yawned, and whistled insolently to himself, while
      Fanny sat without looking at him, as if she were deaf and dumb, Hope Wayne
      said to the husband and wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel Newt is ruining himself, and he may harm other people. If
      there is any thing that can be done to save him we ought to do it. Fanny,
      he is your own flesh and blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a kind of despairing earnestness, for Hope herself felt how
      useless every thing would probably be. But when she had ended Alfred broke
      out into uproarious laughter,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! ho! Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made such a noise that even his wife looked at him with almost a glance
      of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save Abel Newt!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Convert the Devil! Yes,
      yes; let&rsquo;s send him some tracts! Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he roared again until the water oozed from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne scarcely looked at him. She rose to go; but it seemed to her
      pitiful to leave Fanny Newt in such utter desolation of soul and body, in
      which she seemed to her to be gradually sinking into idiocy. She went to
      Fanny and took her hand. Fanny listlessly rose, and when Hope had done
      shaking hands Fanny crossed them before her inanely, but in an
      unconsciously appealing attitude, which Hope saw and felt. Alfred still
      sprawled in his chair; laughing at intervals; and Hope left the room,
      followed by Fanny, who shuffled after her, her slippers, evidently down at
      the heel, pattering on the worn oil-cloth in the entry as she shambled
      toward the front door. Hope opened it. The morning was pleasant, though
      cool, and the air refreshing after the odor of mingled grease and stale
      tobacco-smoke which filled the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed out, Fanny quietly sat down upon the step, leaned her chin
      upon one hand, and looked up and down the street, which, it seemed to
      Hope, offered a prospect that would hardly enliven her mind. There was
      something more touching to Hope in this dull apathy than in the most
      positive grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny Newt!&rdquo; she said to her, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny lifted her lazy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can do nothing for your brother, can I do nothing for you? You
      will rust out, Fanny, if you don&rsquo;t take care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny smiled languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if I do?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Hope sat down by her, and told her just what she meant, and what
      she hoped, and what she would do if she would let her. And the eager young
      woman drew such pleasant pictures of what was yet possible to Fanny,
      although she was the wife of Alfred Dinks, that, as if the
      long-accumulating dust and ashes were blown away from her soul, and it
      began to kindle again in a friendly breath, Fanny felt herself moved and
      interested. She smiled, looked grave, and finally laid her head upon Hope&rsquo;s
      shoulder and cried good, honest tears of utter weariness and regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Hope, &ldquo;will you help me about Abel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see that you can do any thing,&rdquo; said
      Fanny, &ldquo;nor any body else. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll get a new start in
      Congress, though I don&rsquo;t know any thing about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne shook her head thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see no way. I can only be ready to
      befriend him if the chance offers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They said no more of him then, but Hope persuaded Fanny to come to
      Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s Christmas dinner, to which they had all been bidden.
      &ldquo;And I will make him understand about it,&rdquo; she said, as she
      went down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dinks sat upon the door-step for some time. There was nobody to see
      her whom she knew, and if there had been she would not have cared. She did
      not know how long she had been sitting there, for she was thinking of
      other things, but she was roused by hearing her husband&rsquo;s voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by G&mdash;&mdash;! that&rsquo;s a G&mdash;&mdash; d&mdash;&mdash;
      pretty business&mdash;squatting on a door-step like a servant girl! Come
      in, I tell you, and shut the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From long habit Fanny did not pay the least attention to this order. But
      after some time she rose and closed the door, and clattered along the
      entry and up stairs, upon the worn and ragged carpet. Mr. Alfred Dinks
      returned to the parlor, pulled the bell violently, and when the sloppy
      servant girl appeared, glaring at him with the staring eyes, he
      immediately damned them, and wanted to know why in h&mdash;&mdash; he was
      kept waiting for his boots. The staring eyes vanished, and Mr. Dinks
      reclined upon the sofa, picking his teeth. Presently there was the slop&mdash;slop&mdash;slop
      of the girl along the entry. She opened the door, dropped the boots, and
      fled. Mr. Dinks immediately pulled the bell violently, walking across the
      room a greater distance than to his boots. Slop&mdash;slop again. The door
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! If you don&rsquo;t bring me my boots, I&rsquo;ll come
      and pull the hair out of your head!&rdquo; roared the master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cowering little creature dashed at the boots with a wobegone look, and
      brought them to the sofa. Mr. Dinks took them in his hand, and turned them
      round contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G&mdash;&mdash;! You call those boots blacked?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He scratched his head a moment, enjoying the undisguised terror of the
      puny girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t black &lsquo;em better&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t
      put a brighter shine on to 'em, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      put a shine on your face, you slut!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl seemed to be all terrified eye as she looked at him, and then
      fled again, while he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! ho! I&rsquo;ll teach &lsquo;em how&mdash;insolent curs! G&mdash;&mdash;
      d&mdash;&mdash; Paddies! What business have they coming over here? Ho! ho!
      ho!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his slippers upon the parlor floor, Mr. Dinks mounted to his room
      and changed his coat. He tried the door of his wife&rsquo;s room as he
      passed out, and found it locked. He kicked it violently, and bawled,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Dinks! If Miss Wayne calls, tell her I&rsquo;ve
      gone to tell Mr. Abel Newt that she repents, and wants to marry him; and I
      shall add that, having been through the wood, she picks up a crooked stick
      at last. Ho! ho! ho! (Kick.) Good-morning, Mrs. Dinks!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went heavily down stairs and slammed the front door, and was gone for
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were first married, after the bitter conviction that there was
      really no hope of old Burt&rsquo;s wealth, Fanny Dinks had carried matters
      with a high hand, domineering by her superior cleverness, and with a
      superiority that stung and exasperated her husband at every turn. Her
      bitter temper had gradually entirely eaten away the superficial, stupid
      good-humor of his younger days; and her fury of disappointment, carried
      into the detail of life, had gradually confirmed him in all his worst
      habits and obliterated the possibility of better. But the sour, superior
      nature was, as usual, unequal to the struggle. At last it spent itself in
      vain against the massive brutishness of opposition it had itself
      developed, and the reaction came, and now daily stunned her into hopeless
      apathy and abject indifference. Having lost the power of vexing, and
      beyond being really vexed by a being she so utterly despised as her
      husband, there was nothing left but pure passivity and inanition, into
      which she was rapidly declining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dinks kicked loudly and roared at the door, but Mrs. Dinks did not
      heed him. She was sitting in her dingy wrapper, rocking, and pondering
      upon the conversation of the morning&mdash;mechanically rocking, and
      thinking of the Christinas dinner at Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXII. &mdash; THE LOST IS FOUND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a whim of Lawrence&rsquo;s to give dinners; to have them good, and
      to ask only the people he wanted, and who he thought would enjoy
      themselves together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much,&rdquo; he said, quietly, as he conversed with Mrs.
      Bennet, while his guests were assembling, &ldquo;Edward Wynne looks like
      your sister Martha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time Mrs. Bennet had heard her sister&rsquo;s name
      mentioned by any stranger for years. But Lawrence spoke as calmly and
      naturally as if Martha Darro had been the subject of their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Martha!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, sadly; &ldquo;how mysterious
      it was!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband saw her as she spoke, and he was so struck by the mournfulness
      of her face that he came quietly over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my son who was dead is alive again. He was lost and is found,&rdquo;
      said Lawrence Newt, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet looked troubled, startled, almost frightened. The words were
      full of significance, the tone was not to be mistaken. She looked at
      Lawrence Newt with incredulous eagerness. He shook his head assentingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive?&rdquo; she gasped rather than asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And well,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet closed her eyes in a silent prayer. A light so sweet stole
      over her matronly face that Lawrence Newt did not fear to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And near you; come with me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the room together; and Amy Waring, who knew why they went,
      followed her aunt and Lawrence from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three stopped at the door of Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister is here,&rdquo; said he; and Amy and he remained
      outside while Mrs. Bennet entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than twenty years since the sisters had met, and they clasped
      each other silently and wept for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucia!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all they said; and wept again quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha was dressed in sober black. Her face was very comely; for the
      hardness that came with a morbid and mistaken zeal was mellowed, and the
      sadness of experience softened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived not far from you, Lucia, all these long years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha! and you did not come to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not dare. Listen, Lucia. If a woman who had always gratified
      her love of admiration, and gloried in the power of gratifying it&mdash;who
      conquered men and loved to conquer them&mdash;who was a woman of
      ungoverned will and indomitable pride, should encounter&mdash;as how often
      they do?&mdash;a man who utterly conquered her, and betrayed her through
      the very weakness that springs from pride, do you not see that such a
      woman would go near to insanity&mdash;as I have been&mdash;believing that
      I had committed the unpardonable sin, and that no punishment could be
      painful enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet looked alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; there is no reason,&rdquo; said her sister, observing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man came. I could not resist him. There was a form of marriage.
      I believed that it was I who had conquered. He left me; my child was born.
      I appealed to Lawrence Newt, our old friend and playmate. He promised me
      faithful secrecy, and through him the child was sent where Gabriel was at
      school. Then I withdrew from both. I thought it was the will of God. I
      felt myself commanded to a living death&mdash;dead to every friend and
      kinsman&mdash;dead to every thing but my degradation and its punishment;
      and yet consciously close to you, near to all old haunts and familiar
      faces&mdash;lost to them all&mdash;lost to my child&mdash;&rdquo; Her
      voice faltered, and the tears gushed from her eyes. &ldquo;But I
      persevered. The old passionate pride was changed to a kind of religious
      frenzy. Lawrence Newt went and came to and from India. I was utterly lost
      to the world. I knew that my child would never know me, for Lawrence had
      promised that he would not betray me; and when I disappeared from his
      view, Lawrence gradually came to consider me dead. Then Amy discovered me
      among the poor souls she visited, and through Amy Lawrence Newt; and by
      them I have been led out of the valley of the shadow of death, and see the
      blessed light of love once more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed her head in uncontrollable emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your son?&rdquo; said her sister, half-smiling through her
      sympathetic tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will be yours also, Amy tells me,&rdquo; said Aunt Martha. &ldquo;Thank
      God! thank God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha, who gave him his name?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Martha paused for a little while. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never knew who my&mdash;my&mdash;husband was?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember&mdash;he never came to the house. Well, I gave my child
      almost his father&rsquo;s name. I called him Wynne; his father&rsquo;s
      name was Wayne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet clasped her hands in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wonderful! how wonderful!&rdquo; was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt knocked at the door, and Amy and he came in. There was so
      sweet and strange a light upon Amy&rsquo;s face that Mrs. Bennet looked at
      her in surprise. Then she looked at Lawrence Newt; and he cheerfully
      returned her glance with that smiling, musing expression in his eyes that
      was utterly bewildering to Mrs. Bennet. She could only look at each of the
      persons before her, and repeat her last words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wonderful! how wonderful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Waring, who had not heard the previous conversation between her two
      aunts, blushed as she heard these words, as if Mrs. Bennet had been
      alluding to something in which Amy was particularly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy could scarcely raise her eyes. There was an exquisite maidenly shyness
      overspreading her whole person. At length she looked the response she
      could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you?&rdquo; asked her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Amy was utterly unable to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming and going in my house, my dearest niece, and yet hugging
      such a secret, and holding your tongue. Oh Amy, Amy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the words of reproach; but the tone, and look, and impression
      were of entire love and sympathy. Lawrence Newt looked calmly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Lucia, what could I do?&rdquo; was all that Amy could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I do not reproach you; I blame nobody. I am too glad
      and happy. It is too wonderful, wonderful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fullness and intensity of emphasis in what she said that
      apparently made Amy suspect that she had not correctly understood her aunt&rsquo;s
      intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean about Aunt Martha!&rdquo; said Amy, with an air of
      relief and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence Newt smiled. Mrs. Bennet turned to Amy with a fresh look of
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Aunt Martha? Of course about Aunt Martha. Why, Amy, what on
      earth did you suppose it was about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the overwhelming impossibility to reply. Mrs. Bennet was very
      curious. She looked at her sister Martha, who was smiling intelligently.
      Then at Lawrence Newt, who did not cease smiling, as if he were in no
      perplexity whatsoever. Then at Amy, who sat smiling at her through the
      tears that had gathered in the thoughtful womanly brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me speak,&rdquo; said Lawrence Newt, quietly. &ldquo;Why should
      we not all be glad and happy with you? You have found a sister, Aunt
      Martha has found herself and a son, I have found a wife, and Amy a
      husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the room where they had left the guests, and the story
      was quietly told to Hope Wayne and the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope and Edward looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Malacca!&rdquo; she said, in a low tone, putting out her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister Hope,&rdquo; said the young man, blushing, and his large
      eyes filling with tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my sister, too,&rdquo; whispered Ellen Bennet, as she took Hope&rsquo;s
      other hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXIII. &mdash; MRS. DELILAH JONES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Newt&rsquo;s political friends in New York were naturally anxious when
      he went to Washington. They had constant communication with the Honorable
      Mr. Ele in regard to his colleague; for although they were entirely sure
      of Mr. Ele, they could not quite confide in Mr. Newt, nor help feeling
      that, in some eccentric moment, even his interest might fail to control
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, I begin to be sick of it,&rdquo; said General Belch
      to the calm William Condor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That placid gentleman replied that he saw no reason for apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he may let things out, you know,&rdquo; said Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but is not our word as good as his,&rdquo; was the assuring
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, perhaps,&rdquo; said General Belch, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Belch and Condor were forgotten by the representative they had sent to
      Congress when he once snuffed the air of Washington. There was something
      grateful to Abel Newt in the wide sphere and complicated relations of the
      political capital, of which the atmosphere was one of intrigue, and which
      was built over the mines and countermines of selfishness. He hoodwinked
      all Belch&rsquo;s spies, so that the Honorable Mr. Ele could never
      ascertain any thing about his colleague, until once when he discovered
      that the report upon the Grant was to be brought in within a day or two by
      the Committee, and that it would be recommended, upon which he hastened to
      Abel&rsquo;s lodging. He found him smoking as usual, with a decanter at
      hand. It was past midnight, and the room was in the disorder of a bachelor&rsquo;s
      sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele seated himself carelessly, so carelessly that Abel saw at once
      that he had come for some very particular purpose. He offered his friend a
      tumbler and a cigar, and they talked nimbly of a thousand things. Who had
      come, who had gone, and how superb Mrs. Delilah Jones was, who had
      suddenly appeared upon the scene, invested with mystery, and bringing a
      note to each of the colleagues from General Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Delilah Jones,&rdquo; said that gentleman, in a private note
      to Ele, &ldquo;is our old friend, Kitty Dunham. She appears in Washington
      as the widow of a captain in the navy, who died a few years since upon the
      Brazil station. She can be of the greatest service to us; and you must
      have no secrets from each other about our dear friend, who shall be
      nameless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Abel Newt, General Belch wrote: &ldquo;My dear Newt, the lady to whom I
      have given a letter to you is daughter of an old friend of my family. She
      married Captain Jones of the navy, whom she lost some years since upon the
      Brazil station. She has seen the world; has money; and comes to Washington
      to taste life, to enjoy herself&mdash;to doff the sables, perhaps, who
      knows? Be kind to her, and take care of your heart. Don&rsquo;t forget the
      Grant in the arms of Delilah! Yours, Belch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt, when he received this letter, looked over his books of reports
      and statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jones&mdash;Brazil station,&rdquo; he said, skeptically, to
      himself. But he found no such name or event in the obituaries; and he was
      only the more amused by his friend Belch&rsquo;s futile efforts at
      circumvention and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Belch,&rdquo; he replied, after he had made his
      investigations, &ldquo;I have your private note, but I have not yet
      encountered the superb Delilah; nor have I forgotten what you said to me
      about working &lsquo;em through their wives, and sisters, etc. I shall not
      begin to forget it now, and I hope to make the Delilah useful in the
      campaign; for there are goslings here, more than you would believe. Thank
      you for such an ally. <i>You</i>, at least, were not born to fail. Yours,
      A. Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goslings, are there? I believe you,&rdquo; said Belch to himself,
      inwardly chuckling as he read and folded Abel&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ally, hey? Well, that <i>is</i> good,&rdquo; he continued, the
      chuckle rising into a laugh. &ldquo;Well, well, I thought Abel Newt was
      smart; but he doesn&rsquo;t even suspect, and I have played a deeper game
      than was needed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that will fix him,&rdquo; said Abel, as he looked over his
      letter, laughed, folded it, and sent it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele by many a devious path at length approached the object of his
      visit, and hoped that Mr. Newt would flesh his maiden sword in the coming
      fray. Abel said, without removing his cigar, &ldquo;I think I shall speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more. Mr. Ele shook his foot with inward triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Widow Jones will do a smashing business this winter, I suppose,&rdquo;
      he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely,&rdquo; replied Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know her well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele retired, for he had learned all that his friend meant he should
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know Delilah?&rdquo; laughed Abel Newt to himself, as he said
      &ldquo;Good-night, Ele.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes he did. He had followed up his note to General Belch by calling upon
      the superb Mrs. Delilah Jones. But neither the skillful wig, nor the
      freshened cheeks, nor the general repairs which her personal appearance
      had undergone, could hide from Abel the face of Kitty Dunham, whom he had
      sometimes met in other days when suppers were eaten in Grand Street and
      wagons were driven to Cato&rsquo;s. He betrayed nothing, however; and she
      wrote to General Belch that she had disguised herself so that he did not
      recall her in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel was intensely amused by the espionage of the Honorable Mr. Ele and
      the superb Jones. He told his colleague how greatly he had been impressed
      by the widow&mdash;that she was really a fascinating woman, and, by Jove!
      though she was a widow, and no longer twenty, still there were a good many
      worse things a man might do than fall in love with her. &lsquo;Pon honor,
      he did not feel altogether sure of himself, though he thought he was
      hardened if any body was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ele smiled, and said, in a serious way, that she was a splendid woman,
      and if Abel persisted he must look out for a rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For I thought it best to lead him on,&rdquo; he wrote to his friend
      Belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the lady herself, Abel was so dexterous that she really began to
      believe that she might do rather more for herself than her employers. He
      brought to bear upon her the whole force of the fascination which had once
      been so irresistible; and, like a blowpipe, it melted out the whole
      conspiracy against him without her knowing that she had betrayed it. The
      point of her instructions from Belch was that she was to persuade him to
      be constant to the Grant at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then, Mr. Newt,&rdquo; she said to him, as they stood
      together in the crush of a levee at the White House&mdash;&ldquo;<i>our</i>
      bill is to be reported, and favorably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delilah Jones was a pretty woman, and shrewd. She had large eyes;
      languishing at will&mdash;at will, also, bright and piercing. Her face was
      a smiling, mobile face; the features rather coarse, the expression almost
      vulgar, but the vulgarity well concealed. She was dressed in the extreme
      of the mode, and drew Mr. Newt&rsquo;s arm very close to her as she spoke.
      She observed that Mr. Newt was more than usually disposed to chat. The
      honorable representative had dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Our</i> bill, Lady Delilah? Thank you for that,&rdquo; said
      Abel, in a low voice, and almost pressing the hand that lay upon his
      close-held arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was a slow turn of the head, and a half languishment in the eyes
      as they sought his with the air of saying, &ldquo;Would you deceive a
      woman who trusts in you utterly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved out of the throng a little, and stood by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I dared to ask you one thing as a pure favor,&rdquo; said
      the superb Mrs. Delilah Jones, and this time the eyes were firm and
      bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped, by this time, that you dared every thing,&rdquo; replied
      Abel, with a vague reproach in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jones looked at him for a moment with a look of honest inquiry in her
      eyes. His own did not falter. Their expression combined confidence and
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I then ask,&rdquo; she said, earnestly, and raising her other
      hand as if to lay it imploringly upon his shoulder, but somehow it fell
      into his hand, which was raised simultaneously, and which did not let it
      go&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake, will you speak in favor of it?&rdquo; she asked,
      casting her eyes down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your sake, Delilah,&rdquo; he said, in a musical whisper, and
      under the rouge her cheeks tingled&mdash;&ldquo;for your sake I will make
      a speech&mdash;my maiden speech.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more conversation between them. The Honorable Mr. Ele stood
      guard, so to speak, and by incessant chatter warded off the company from
      pressing upon them unawares. The guests, smiled as they looked on; and
      after the levee the newspapers circulated rumors (it was before the days
      of &ldquo;Personal&rdquo;) that were read with profound interest
      throughout the country, that the young and talented representative from
      the commercial emporium had not forfeited his reputation as a squire of
      dames, and gossip already declared that the charming and superb Mrs.
      D-li-h J-nes would ere long exchange that honored name for one not less
      esteemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Abel returned from the levee he threw himself into his chair, and
      said, aloud,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t a man lucky who is well paid for doing just what he
      meant to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Abel Newt intended to get all he could from the Grant, and to enjoy
      himself as fully as possible while getting it; but he had his own work to
      do, and to that his power was devoted. To make a telling speech upon the
      winning side was one of his plans, and accordingly he made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bill was reported as it had been drafted by his friends in New
      York, it had been arranged that Mr. Newt should catch the speaker&rsquo;s
      eye. His figure and face attracted attention, and his career in Washington
      had already made him somewhat known. During the time he had been there his
      constant employment had been a study of the House and of its individual
      members, as well as of the general character and influence of the
      speeches. His shrewdness showed him the shallows, the currents, and the
      reefs. Day after day he saw a great many promising plans, like full-sailed
      ships, ground upon the flats of dullness, strike rocks of prejudice, or
      whirl in the currents of crudity, until they broke up and went down out of
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and his first words arrested attention. He treated the House with
      consummate art, as he might have treated a woman whom he wished to
      persuade. The House was favorably inclined before. It was resolved when he
      sat down. For he had shown so clearly that it was one of the cases in
      which patriotism and generosity&mdash;the finer feelings and only a
      moderate expense&mdash;were all one, that the majority, who were
      determined to pass the Grant in any case, were charmed to have the action
      so imposingly stated; and the minority, who knew that it was useless to
      oppose it, enjoyed the rhetoric of the speech, and, as it was brief, and
      did not encroach upon dinner-time, smiled approval, and joined in the
      congratulation to Mr. Newt upon his very eloquent and admirable oration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the congratulations Abel raised his eyes to Mrs. Delilah
      Jones, who sat conspicuous in the gallery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXIV. &mdash; PROSPECTS OF HAPPINESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Honorable Abel Newt was the lion of the hour. Days of dinner
      invitations and evening parties suddenly returned. He did not fail to use
      the rising tide. It helped to float him more securely to the fulfillment
      of his great work. Meanwhile he saw Mrs. Jones every day. She no longer
      tried to play a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of his speech was scattered abroad in the papers. General Belch
      rubbed his hands and expectorated with an energy that showed the warmth of
      his feeling. Far away in quiet Delafield, when the news arrived, Mr.
      Savory Gray lost no time in improving the pregnant text. The great moral
      was duly impressed upon the scholars that Mr. Newt was a great man because
      he had been one of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s boys. The Washington world soon knew
      his story, the one conspicuous fact being that he was the favorite nephew
      of the rich merchant, Lawrence Newt. All the doors flew open. The dinner
      invitations, the evening notes, fell upon his table more profusely than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sneered at his triumph. Ambition, political success, social prestige
      had no fascination for a man who was half imbruted, and utterly
      disappointed and worn out. One thing only Abel really wanted. He wanted
      money&mdash;money, which could buy the only pleasures of which he was now
      capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Delilah&mdash;I like that name better than Kitty, it
      means something&mdash;you know Belch. So do I. Do you suppose a man would
      work with him or for him except for more advantage than he can insure? Or
      do you think <i>I</i> want to slave for the public&mdash;<i>I</i> work for
      the public? God! would I be every man&rsquo;s drudge? No, Mrs. Delilah
      Jones, emphatically not. I will be my own master, and yours, and my
      revered uncle will foot the bills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at him inquiringly. She was a willing captive. She
      accepted him as master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for you to know how he will pay,&rdquo; said Abel,
      &ldquo;but to enjoy the fruits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, in whose face there were yet the ruins of a coarse beauty,
      which pleased Abel now as the most fiery liquor gratified his palate,
      looked at him, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, what are we to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be happy,&rdquo; he answered, with the old hard, black light in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She almost shuddered as she heard the tone and saw the look, and yet she
      did not feel as if she could escape the spell of his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be happy!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;To be happy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice fell as she spoke the words; Her life had not been a long one.
      She had laughed a great deal, but she had never been happy. She knew Abel
      from old days. She saw him now, sodden, bloated&mdash;but he fascinated
      her still. Was he the magician to conjure happiness for her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your plan?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have two passages taken in a brig for the Mediterranean. We go to
      New York a day or two before she sails. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked his companion, with wonder and doubt in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then a blissful climate and happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; she persisted, in a low, doubtful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Hell&mdash;if you are anxious for it,&rdquo; said Abel, in a
      sharp, sudden voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman cowered as she sat. Men had often enough sworn at her; but
      she recoiled from the roughness of this lover as if it hurt her. Her eyes
      were not languishing now, but startled&mdash;then slowly they grew dim and
      soft with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt looked at her, surprised and pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, you&rsquo;re a woman still, and I like it. It&rsquo;s so
      much the better. I don&rsquo;t want a dragon or a machine. Come, girl, are
      you afraid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me&mdash;of the future&mdash;of any thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice had a lingering music of the same kind as the
      lingering beauty in her face. It was a sensual, seductive sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not afraid,&rdquo; she answered, turning to him. &ldquo;But,
      oh! my God! my God! if we were only both young again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with passionate hopelessness, and the tears dried in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening Mrs. Delilah Jones appeared at the French minister&rsquo;s
      ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon the whole,&rdquo; said Mr. Ele to his partner, &ldquo;I have
      never seen Mrs. Jones so superb as she is to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood by the mantle, queen-like&mdash;so the representatives from
      several States remarked&mdash;and all the evening fresh comers offered
      homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; said the old Brazilian ambassador, as he
      gazed at her through his eye-glass, and smacked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tiens!</i>&rdquo; responded the sexagenarian representative from
      Chili, half-closing one eye.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXV. &mdash; GETTING READY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hope Wayne had not forgotten the threat which Abel had vaguely thrown out;
      but she supposed it was only an expression of disappointment and
      indignation. Could she have seen him a few evenings after the ball and his
      conversation with Mrs. Delilah Jones, she might have thought differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat with the same woman in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then?&rdquo; she said, looking at him, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he answered, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope all will go well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All what?&rdquo; he asked, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All our plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel Newt was not born to fail,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;or at
      least General Belch said so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion had no knowledge of what Abel really meant to do. She only
      knew that he was capable of every thing, and as for herself, her little
      mask had fallen, and she did not even wish to pick it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat together silently for a long time. He poured freely and drank
      deeply, and whiffed cigar after cigar nervously away. The few bells of the
      city tolled the hours. Ele had come during the evening and knocked at the
      door, but Abel did not let him in. He and his companion sat silently, and
      heard the few bells strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Kitty,&rdquo; he said at last, thickly, and with glazing eye.
      &ldquo;Well, my Princess of the Mediterranean. We shall be happy, hey? You&rsquo;re
      not afraid even now, hey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we shall be very happy,&rdquo; she replied, in a low, wild
      tone, as if it were the night wind that moaned, and not a woman&rsquo;s
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for a few moments. He saw how entirely she was enthralled
      by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I care any thing about you?&rdquo; he said at length,
      leering at her through the cigar-smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you do,&rdquo; she answered, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my&mdash;my&mdash;dear Mrs. Jones&mdash;the su-superb Mrs.
      Delilah Jo-Jones ought to be sure that I do. Here, bring me a light: that
      dam&mdash;dam&mdash;cigar&rsquo;s gone out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose quietly and carried the candle to Abel. There was an
      inexpressible weariness and pathos in all her movements: a kind of womanly
      tranquillity that was touchingly at variance with the impression of her
      half-coarse appearance. As Abel watched her he remembered the women whom
      he had tried to marry. His memory scoured through his whole career. He
      thought of them all variously happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear! to think I should come to you!&rdquo; he said at length,
      looking at his companion, with an indescribable bitterness of sneering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty Dunham sat at a little distance from him on the end of a sofa. She
      was bowed as if deeply thinking; and when she heard these words her head
      only sank a little more, as if a palpable weight had been laid upon her.
      She understood perfectly what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am not worth loving,&rdquo; she said, in the same low
      voice, &ldquo;but my love will do you no harm. Perhaps I can help you in
      some way. If you are ill some day, I can nurse you. I shall be poor
      company on the long journey, but I will try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What long journey?&rdquo; asked Abel, suddenly and angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where we are going,&rdquo; she replied, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; it, then, don&rsquo;t use such am-am-big-&rsquo;us
      phrases. A man would think we were go-going to die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said no more, but sat, half-crouching, upon the sofa, looking into the
      fire. Abel glanced at her, from time to time, with maudlin grins and
      sneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed,&rdquo; he said at length; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to
      do. Sleep all you can; you&rsquo;ll need it. I shall stay here &lsquo;till
      I&rsquo;m ready to go, and come for you in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she answered, and rose quietly. &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good-night, Mrs. De-de-liah&mdash;superb Jo-Jones!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as she went&mdash;sat ogling the fire for a little while, and
      then unsteadily, but not unconsciously, drew a pocket-book from his pocket
      and took out a small package. It contained several notes, amounting to not
      less than a hundred thousand dollars signed by himself, and indorsed by
      Lawrence Newt &amp; Co.&mdash;at least the name was there, and it was a
      shrewd eye that could detect the difference between the signature and that
      which was every day seen and honored in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked at them carefully, and leered and glared upon them as if they
      had been windows through which he saw something&mdash;sunny isles, and
      luxury, and a handsome slave who loved him to minister to every whim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a pretty game,&rdquo; he said, half aloud; &ldquo;a
      droll turnabout is life. Uncle Lawrence plays against other people, and
      wins. I play against Uncle Lawrence, and win. But what&rsquo;s un-dred&mdash;sousand&mdash;to&mdash;him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it drowsily, and his hands unconsciously fell. He was asleep in
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there sleeping until the gray of morning. Kitty Dunham, coming into
      the room ready-dressed for a journey, found him there. She was frightened;
      for he looked as if he were dead. Going up to him she shook him, and he
      awoke heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the h&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said he, as he
      opened his sleepy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s time to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be happy,&rdquo; she said, standing passively and looking in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m all ready. I&rsquo;ve only to stop at my room for
      my trunk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His hair was tangled, his eyes were bloodshot, his clothes tumbled and
      soiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to dress yourself?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; ain&rsquo;t I dressed enough for you? No gentleman dresses
      when he&rsquo;s going to travel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said no more. The carriage came as Abel had ordered, a private
      conveyance to take them quite through to New York. All the time before it
      came Kitty Dunham moved solemnly about the room, seeing that nothing was
      left. The solemnity fretted Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you so sober about?&rdquo; he asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am getting ready for a long journey,&rdquo; she answered,
      tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not so long,&rdquo; he said, sharply&mdash;&ldquo;not if I
      choose to leave you behind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you will want somebody, and I&rsquo;m the only person in
      the world left to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in the same sober way. Abel knew perfectly well that she spoke
      the truth, but he had never thought of it before. Was he then going so
      long a journey without a friend, unless she went with him? Was she the
      only one left of all the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      As his mind pondered the question his eye fell upon a newspaper of the day
      before, in which he saw his name. He took it up mechanically, and read a
      paragraph praising him and his speech; foretelling &ldquo;honor and troops
      of friends&rdquo; for a young man who began his public career so
      brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There; hear this!&rdquo; said he, as he read it aloud and looked at
      his companion. &ldquo;Troops of friends, do you see? and yet you talk of
      being my only dependence in the world! Fie! fie! Mrs. Delilah Jones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was melancholy merriment. He did not smile, and the woman&rsquo;s face
      was quietly sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the present, then, Mr. Speaker and fellow-citizens,&rdquo; said
      Abel Newt, waving his hand as he saw that every thing was ready, and that
      the carriage waited only for him and his companion, &ldquo;I bid these
      scenes adieu! For the present I terminate my brief engagement. And you, my
      fellow-members, patterns of purity and pillars of truth, farewell!
      Disinterested patriots, I leave you my blessing! Pardon me that I prefer
      the climate of the Mediterranean to that of the District, and the smiles
      of my Kitty to the intelligent praises of my country. Friends of my soul,
      farewell! I kiss my finger tips! Boo&mdash;hoo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a mock bow, and smiled upon an imaginary audience. Then offering
      his arm with grave ceremony to his companion as if a crowd had been
      looking on, he went down stairs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXVI. &mdash; IN THE CITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a long journey. They stopped at Baltimore, at Philadelphia, and
      pushed on toward New York. While they were still upon the way Hope Wayne
      saw what she had been long expecting to see&mdash;and saw it without a
      solitary regret. Amy Waring was Amy Waring no longer; and Hope Wayne was
      the first who kissed Mrs. Lawrence Newt. Even Mrs. Simcoe looked
      benignantly upon the bride; and Aunt Martha wept over her as over her own
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very day of the wedding Abel Newt and his companion arrived at Jersey
      City. Leaving Kitty in a hotel, he crossed the river, and ascertained that
      the vessel on which he had taken two berths under a false name was full
      and ready, and would sail upon her day. He showed himself in Wall Street,
      carefully dressed, carefully sober&mdash;evidently mindful, people said,
      of his new position; and they thought his coming home showed that he was
      on good terms with his family, and that he was really resolved to behave
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a day or two he appeared in the business streets and offices, and
      talked gravely of public measures. General Belch was confounded by the
      cool sobriety, and superiority, and ceremony of the Honorable Mr. Newt.
      When he made a joke, Abel laughed with such patronizing politeness that
      the General was frightened, and tried no more. When he treated Abel
      familiarly, and told him what a jolly lift his speech had given to their
      common cause&mdash;the Grant&mdash;the Honorable Mr. Newt replied, with a
      cold bow, that he was glad if he had done his duty and satisfied his
      constituents; bowing so coldly that the General was confounded. He spat
      into his fire, and said, &ldquo;The Devil!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Abel had gone, General Belch was profoundly conscious that King Log
      was better than King Stork, and thought regretfully of the Honorable
      Watkins Bodley.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a day or two the Honorable Mr. Newt went to his Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s
      office. Abel had not often been there. He had never felt himself to be
      very welcome there; and as he came into the inner room where Lawrence and
      Gabriel sat, they were quite as curious to know why he had come as he was
      to know what his reception would be. Abel bowed politely, and said he
      could not help congratulating his uncle upon the news he had heard, but
      would not conceal his surprise. What his surprise was he did not explain;
      but Lawrence very well knew. Abel had the good sense not to mention, the
      name of Hope Wayne, and not to dwell upon any subject that involved
      feeling. He said that he hoped by-gones would be by-gones; that he had
      been a wild boy, but that a career now opened upon him of which he hoped
      to prove worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a time, Uncle Lawrence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I
      despised your warning; now I thank you for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence held out his hand to his nephew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy, at least, if nothing more,&rdquo; he
      said, smiling. &ldquo;You have a chance; I hope, with all my heart, you
      will use it well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little more to say, and of that little Gabriel said nothing.
      Abel spoke of public affairs; and after a short time he took leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can the leopard change his spots?&rdquo; said Gabriel, looking at
      the senior partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad man may become better,&rdquo; was all the answer; and the two
      merchants were busy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to Wall Street, the Honorable Abel Newt met Mr. President Van
      Boozenberg. They shook hands, and the old gentleman said, warmly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see ye goin&rsquo; into your Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s a while ago,
      as I was comin&rsquo; along South Street. Mr. Abel, Sir, I congratilate
      ee, Sir. I&rsquo;ve read your speech, and I sez to ma, sez I, I&rsquo;d no
      idee of it; none at all. Ma, sez she, Law, pa! I allers knowed Mr. Abel
      Newt would turn up trumps. You allers did have the women, Mr. Newt; and so
      I told ma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad, Sir, that I have at last done something to deserve
      your approbation. I trust I shall not forfeit it. I have led rather a gay
      life, and careless; and my poor father and I have met with misfortunes.
      But they open a man&rsquo;s eyes, Sir; they are angels in disguise, as the
      poet says. I don&rsquo;t doubt they have been good for me. At least I&rsquo;m
      resolved now to be steady and industrious; and I certainly should be a
      great fool if I were not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, Sir, with your chances and prospects, yes, and your
      talents, coz, I allers said to ma, sez I, he&rsquo;s got talent if he hain&rsquo;t
      nothin&rsquo; else. I suppose your Uncle Lawrence won&rsquo;t be so shy of
      you now, hey? No, of course not. A man who has a smart nevy in Congress
      has a tap in a good barrel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Van Boozenberg laughed loudly at his own humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Sir. I think I may say that the pleasantest part of my
      new life&mdash;if you will allow me to use the expression&mdash;is my
      return to the friends best worth having. I think I have learned, Sir, that
      steady-going business, with no nonsense about it, is the permanent thing.
      It isn&rsquo;t flopdoddle, Sir, but it&rsquo;s solid food.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tonguey,&rdquo; thought old Jacob Van Boozenberg, &ldquo;but vastly
      improved. Has come to terms with Uncle Lawrence. Sensible fellow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he takes it,&rdquo; said Abel to himself, with the feeling
      of an angler, as he watched the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before they parted Abel took out his pocket-book and told Mr. Van
      Boozenberg that he should like to negotiate a little piece of paper which
      was not altogether worthless, he believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling as he spoke, he handed a note for twenty-five thousand dollars,
      with his uncle&rsquo;s indorsement, to the President. The old gentleman
      looked at it carefully, smiled knowingly, &ldquo;Yes, yes, I see. Sly dog,
      that Uncle Lawrence. I allers sez so. This ere&rsquo;s for the public
      service, I suppose, eh! Mr. Newt?&rdquo; and the President chuckled over
      his confirmed conviction that Lawrence Newt was &ldquo;jes&rsquo; like
      other folks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked Abel to walk with him to the bank. They chatted as they passed
      along, nodded to those they knew, while some bowed politely to the young
      member whom they saw in such good company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Zephyr Wetherley as he skimmed up Wall
      Street from the bank, where he had been getting dividends, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      think to see the day when Abel Newt would be a solid, sensible man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Wetherley wondered, in a sighing way, what was the secret of Abel&rsquo;s
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honorable member came out of the bank with the money in his pocket.
      When the clock struck three he had the amount of all the notes in the form
      of several bills of foreign exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went hastily to the river side and crossed to Jersey City.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have sent to say that the ship sails at nine in the morning,
      and that we must be on board early,&rdquo; said Kitty Dunham, as he
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all ready,&rdquo; he replied, in a clear, cold, alert voice.
      &ldquo;Now sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was not to be resisted. The woman seated herself quietly and
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My affectionate Uncle Lawrence has given me a large sum of money,
      and recommends travelling for my health. The money is in bills on London
      and Paris. To-morrow morning we sail. We post to London&mdash;get the
      money; same day to Paris&mdash;get the money; straight on to Marseilles,
      and sail for Sicily. There we can take breath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke rapidly, but calmly. She heard and understood every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could sail to-night,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of time&mdash;plenty of time,&rdquo; answered Abel. &ldquo;And
      why be so anxious for so long a journey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems long to you, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; it will be long. Yes, I am going on a long journey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled with the hard black eyes a hard black smile. Kitty did not
      smile; but she took his hand gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel shook his head, mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Delilah Jones, you overcome me with your
      sentimentality. I don&rsquo;t believe in love. That&rsquo;s what I believe
      in,&rdquo; said he, as he opened his pocket-book and showed her the bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at them unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are the delicate little keys of the Future,&rdquo; chuckled
      Abel, as he gloated over the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman raised her eyes and looked into his. They were busy with the
      bills. Then with the same low tone, as if the wind were wailing, she
      asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, tell me, before we go upon this long journey, don&rsquo;t you
      love me in the least?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sank into an almost inaudible whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel turned and looked at her, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love you? Why, woman, what is love? No, I don&rsquo;t love you. I
      don&rsquo;t love any body. But that&rsquo;s no matter; you shall go with
      me as if I did. You know, as well as I do, that I can&rsquo;t whine and
      sing silly. I&rsquo;ll be your friend, and you&rsquo;ll be mine, and this
      shall be the friend of both,&rdquo; said he, as he raised the bills in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat beside him silent, and her eyes were hot and dry, not wet with
      tears. There was a look of woe in her face so touching and appealing that,
      when Abel happened to see it, he said, involuntarily,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening came, and the Honorable Mr. Newt rose and walked about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How slowly the time passes!&rdquo; he said, pettishly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      stand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock. Suddenly he sprang up from beside Kitty Dunham,
      who was silently working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I really can not stand it. I&rsquo;ll
      run over to town, and be back by midnight. I do want to see the old place
      once more before that long journey,&rdquo; he added, with emphasis, as he
      put on his coat and hat. He ran from the room, and was just going out of
      the house when he heard a muffled voice calling to him from up stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Kitty, what is it?&rdquo; he asked, as he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. Alarmed for a moment, he leaped up the stairs. She
      stood waiting for him at the door of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed he, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forgot to kiss me, Abel,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her by the shoulders, and looked at her before him. In her eyes
      there were pity, and gentleness, and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he said, half-pleased, half-vexed&mdash;kissed her,
      and rushed out into the street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXVII. &mdash; A LONG JOURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Abel Newt ran to the ferry and crossed. Then he gained Broadway, and
      sauntered into one of the hells in Park Row. It was bright and full, and
      he saw many an old friend. They nodded to him, and said, &ldquo;Ah! back
      again!&rdquo; and he smiled, and said a man must not be too virtuous all
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he ventured a little, and won; ventured a little more, and lost.
      Ventured a little more, and won again; and lost again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came supper, and wine flowed freely. Old friends must pledge in
      bumpers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To work again, and the bells striking midnight. Win, lose; lose, win; win,
      win, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt smiled: his face was red, his eyes glaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played enough,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the luck&rsquo;s
      against me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hands rapidly through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cash I can not pay,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but here is my I O U,
      and a check of my Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s in the morning; for I have no
      account, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was rough. It was two o&rsquo;clock in the morning; and the
      lonely woman he had left sat waiting and wondering: stealing to the front
      door and straining her eyes into the night: stealing softly back again to
      press her forehead against the window: and the quiet hopelessness of her
      face began to be pricked with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Abel, huskily and savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh around the table at which he had been playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Takes it hardly, now that he&rsquo;s got money,&rdquo; said one of
      his old cronies. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s made up with Uncle Lawrence, I hear.
      Hope he&rsquo;ll come often, hey?&rdquo; he said to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bank smiled vaguely, but did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after two, and Abel burst into the street. He had been drinking
      brandy, and the fires were lighted within him. Pulling his hat heavily
      upon his head, he moved unsteadily along the street toward the ferry. The
      night was starry and still. There were few passers in the street; and no
      light but that which shone at some of the corners,-the bad, red eye that
      lures to death. The night air struck cool upon his face and into his
      lungs. His head was light.&mdash;He reeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mus ha&rsquo; some drink,&rdquo; he said, thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled, and staggered into the nearest shop. There was a counter,
      with large yellow barrels behind it; and a high blind, behind which two or
      three rough-looking men were drinking. In the window there was a sign,
      &ldquo;Liquors, pure as imported.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was dingy and cold. The floor was sanded. The two or three
      guests were huddled about a stove&mdash;one asleep upon a bench, the
      others smoking short pipes; and their hard, cadaverous faces and sullen
      eyes turned no welcome upon Abel when he entered, but they looked at him
      quickly, as if they suspected him to be a policeman or magistrate, and as
      if they had reason not to wish to see either. But in a moment they saw it
      was not a sober man, whoever he was. Abel tried to stand erect, to look
      dignified, to smooth himself into apparent sobriety. He vaguely hoped to
      give the impression that he was a gentleman belated upon his way home, and
      taking a simple glass for comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dick, don&rsquo;t yer know him?&rdquo; said one, in a low
      voice, to his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, d&mdash;&mdash; him! and don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, though,&rdquo; replied the first man, still watching the
      new-comer curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jim, who in h&mdash;&mdash; is it?&rdquo; asked Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That air man&rsquo;s our representative. That ain&rsquo;t nobody
      else but Abel Newt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; muttered Jim, sullenly, as he surveyed the general
      appearance of Abel while he stood drinking a glass of brandy&mdash;&ldquo;pure
      as imported&rdquo;&mdash;at the counter&mdash;&ldquo;well, we&rsquo;ve
      done lots for him: what&rsquo;s he going to do for us? We&rsquo;ve put
      that man up tremendious high; d&rsquo;ye think he&rsquo;s going to kick
      away the ladder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He half grumbled to himself, half asked his neighbor Dick. They were both
      a little drunk, and very surly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno. But he&rsquo;s vastly high and mighty&mdash;that I know;
      and, by &mdash;&mdash;, I&rsquo;ll tell him so!&rdquo; said Dick,
      energetically clasping his hands, bringing one of them down upon the bench
      on which he sat, and clenching every word with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Jim! let&rsquo;s make him give us somethin&rsquo; to drink!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two constituents approached the representative whose election they had
      so ardently supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Newt, how air ye?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt was confounded at being accosted in such a place at such an
      hour. He raised his heavy eyes as he leaned unsteadily against the
      counter, and saw two beetle-browed, square-faced, disagreeable-looking men
      looking at him with half-drunken, sullen insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Newt! how air ye?&rdquo; repeated Jim, as he confronted the
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked at him with shaking head, indignant and scornful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil are you?&rdquo; he asked, at length, blurring the
      words as he spoke, and endeavoring to express supreme contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the men that made yer!&rdquo; retorted Dick, in a
      shrill, tipsy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The liquor-seller, who was leaning upon his counter, was instantly
      alarmed. He knew the signs of impending danger. He hurried round, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come; I&rsquo;m going to shut up! Time to go home; time to go
      home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men at the counter did not move. As they stood facing each other
      the brute fury kindled more and more fiercely in each one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Jim and Dick, and Ned&rsquo;s asleep yonder on the
      bench; and we&rsquo;re come to drink a glass with yer, Honorable Abel
      Newt!&rdquo; said Dick, in a sneering tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s we what did
      your business for ye. What yer going to do for us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a menacing air in his eye as he glanced at Abel, who felt
      himself quiver with impotent, blind rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dun&mdash;dun&mdash;no ye!&rdquo; he said, with maudlin dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men pressed nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to go home! Time to go home!&rdquo; quavered the
      liquor-seller; and Ned opened his eyes, and slowly raised his huge frame
      from the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; asked he of his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Honorable Abel Newt&rsquo;s the row,&rdquo; said Jim, pointing
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something peculiarly irritating to Abel in the pointing finger.
      Holding by the counter, he raised his hand and struck at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ned rolled his body off the bench in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; gasped the little liquor-seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim and Dick stood hesitatingly, glaring at Abel. Jim struck his teeth
      together. Ned joined them, and they surrounded Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in &mdash;&mdash; do you mean by striking me, you drunken pig?&rdquo;
      growled Jim, but not yet striking. Conscious of his strength, he had the
      instinctive forbearance of superiority, but it was fast mastered by the
      maddening liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to go home! Time to go home!&rdquo; cried the thin piping
      voice of the liquor-seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the &mdash;&mdash; do you mean by insulting my friend?&rdquo;
      half hiccuped Dick, shaking his head threateningly, and stiffening his arm
      and fist at his side as he edged toward Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard black eyes of Abel Newt shot sullen fire; His rage half sobered
      him. He threw his head with the old defiant air, tossing the hair back.
      The old beauty flashed for an instant through the ruin that had been
      wrought in his face, and, kindling into a wild, glittering look of wrath,
      his eye swept them all as he struck heavily forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to go home! Time to go home!&rdquo; came the cry again,
      unheeded, unheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden, fierce, brutal struggle. The men&rsquo;s faces were
      human no longer, but livid with bestial passion. The liquor-seller rushed
      into the street, and shouted aloud for help. The cry rang along the dark,
      still houses, and startled the drowsy, reluctant watchmen on their rounds.
      They sprang their rattles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder! murder!&rdquo; was the cry, which did not disturb the
      neighbors, who were heavy sleepers, and accustomed to noise and fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder! murder!&rdquo; It rang nearer and nearer as the watchmen
      hastened toward the corner. They found the little man standing at his
      door, bareheaded, and shouting,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God! they&rsquo;ve killed a man&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
      killed a man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your noise, and let us in. What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man pointed back into his dim shop. The watchmen saw only the
      great yellow round tanks of the liquor pure as imported, and pushed in
      behind the blind. There was no one there; a bench was overturned, and
      there were glasses upon the counter. No one there? One of the watchmen
      struck something with his foot, and, stooping, touched a human body. He
      started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not say dead, or drunk; but his tone said every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them ran to the next doctor, and returned with him after a little
      while. Meanwhile the others had raised the body. It was yet warm. They
      laid it upon the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warm still. Stunned, I reckon. I see no blood, except about the
      face. Well dressed. What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo; The doctor said so
      as he felt the pulse. He carefully turned the body over, examined it every
      where, looked earnestly at the face, around which the matted hair
      clustered heavily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone upon his long journey!&rdquo; said the young doctor, in
      a low, solemn tone, still looking at the face with an emotion of sad
      sympathy, for it was a face that had been very handsome; and it was a
      young man, like himself. The city bells clanged three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at his handkerchief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They found it, and handed it to the young doctor. He unrolled it, holding
      it smooth in his hands; suddenly his face turned pale; the tears burst
      into his eyes. A curious throng of recollections and emotions overpowered
      him. His heart ached as he leaned over the body; and laying the matted
      hair away, he looked long and earnestly into the face. In that dim moment
      in the liquor-shop, by that bruised body, how much he saw! A play-ground
      loud with boys&mdash;wide-branching elms&mdash;a country church&mdash;a
      placid pond. He heard voices, and summer hymns, and evening echoes; and
      all the images and sounds were soft, and pensive, and remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s name was Greenidge&mdash;James Greenidge, and he had
      known Abel Newt at school.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXVIII. &mdash; WAITING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The woman Abel had left sat quivering and appalled. Every sound started
      her; every moment she heard him coming. Rocking to and fro in the lonely
      room, she dropped into sudden sleep&mdash;saw him&mdash;started up&mdash;cried,
      &ldquo;How could you stay so?&rdquo; then sat broad awake, and knew that
      she had dozed but for a moment, and that she was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel, Abel!&rdquo; she moaned, in yearning agony. &ldquo;But he
      kissed me before he went,&rdquo; she thought, wildly&mdash;&ldquo;he
      kissed me&mdash;he kissed me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lulled for a moment by the remembrance, she sank into another brief nap&mdash;saw
      him as she had seen him in his gallant days, and heard him say, I love
      you. &ldquo;How could you stay so?&rdquo; she cried, dreaming&mdash;started&mdash;sprang
      up erect, with her head turned in intense listening. There was a sound
      this time; yes, across the river she heard the solemn city bells strike
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearily pacing the room&mdash;stealthily, that she might make no noise&mdash;walking
      the hours away, the lonely woman waited for her lover. The winter, wind
      rose and wailed about the windows and moaned in the chimney, and in long,
      shrieking sobs died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel! Abel!&rdquo; she whispered, and started at the strangeness of
      her voice. She opened the window softly and looked out. The night was cold
      and, calm again, and the keen stars twinkled. She saw nothing&mdash;she
      heard no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed it again, and paced the room. There were no tears in her eyes;
      but they were wide open, startled, despairing. For the first time in her
      terrible life she had loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he kissed me before he went,&rdquo; she said, pleadingly, to
      herself; &ldquo;he kissed me&mdash;he kissed me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it when the solemn city bells struck three. She said it when the
      first dim light of dawn stole into the chamber. And when the full day
      broke, and she heard the earliest footfalls in the street, her heart clung
      to it as the only memory left to her of all her life:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kissed me! he kissed me!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXXXIX. &mdash; DUST TO DUST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Abel left the bank, after obtaining the money, than Gabriel
      came in, and, upon seeing the notes which Mr. Van Boozenberg had shown
      him, in order to make every thing sure in so large a transaction,
      announced that they were forged. The President was quite beside himself,
      and sat down in his room, wringing his hands and crying; while the
      messenger ran for a carriage, into which Gabriel stepped with Mr. Van
      Boozenberg, and drove as rapidly as possible to the office of the Chief of
      Police, who promised to set his men to work at once; but the search was
      suddenly terminated by the bills found upon the body of Abel Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers were full of the dreadful news. They said they were deeply
      shocked to announce that a disgrace had befallen the whole city in the
      crime which had mysteriously deprived his constituency and his country of
      the services of the young, talented, promising representative, whose
      opening career had seemed to be in every way so auspicious. By what foul
      play he had been made way with was a matter for the strictest legal
      investigation, and the honor of the country demanded that the perpetrators
      of such an atrocious tragedy should be brought to condign punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning papers followed next day with fuller details of the awful
      event. Some of the more enterprising had diagrams of the shop, the blind,
      the large yellow barrels that held the liquor pure as imported, the bench,
      the counter, and the spot (marked O) where the officer had found the body.
      In parlors, in banks, in groceries and liquor-shops, in lawyers&rsquo;
      rooms and insurance offices, the murder was the chief topic of
      conversation for a day. Then came the report of the inquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no clew to the murderers. The eager, thirsty-eyed crowd of men,
      and women, and children, crushing and hanging about the shop, gradually
      loosened their gaze. The jury returned that the deceased Abel Newt came to
      his death by the hands of some person or persons unknown. The shop was
      closed, officers were left in charge, and the body was borne away.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch was in his office reading the morning paper when Mr. William
      Condor entered. They shook hands. Upon the General&rsquo;s fat face there
      was an expression of horror and perplexity, but Mr. Condor was perfectly
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an awful thing!&rdquo; said Belch, as the other sat down
      before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightful,&rdquo; said Mr. Condor, placidly, as he lighted a cigar,
      &ldquo;but not surprising.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you suppose did it?&rdquo; asked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible to tell. A drunken brawl, with its natural consequences;
      that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; but it&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providential.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abel Newt would have made mince-meat of you and me and the rest of
      us if he had lived. That&rsquo;s what I mean,&rdquo; replied Mr. Condor,
      unruffled, and lightly whiffing the smoke. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s necessary
      to draw some resolutions to offer in the committee, and I&rsquo;ve brought
      them with me. You know there&rsquo;s a special meeting called to take
      notice of this deplorable event, and you must present them. Shall I read
      them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Condor drew a piece of paper from his pocket, and, holding his cigar
      in one hand and whiffing at intervals, read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas our late associate and friend, Abel Newt, has been suddenly
      removed from this world, in the prime of his life and the height of his
      usefulness, by the hand of an inscrutable but all-wise Providence, to
      whose behests we desire always to bow in humble resignation; and
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas, it is eminently proper that those to whom great public
      trusts have been confided by their fellow-citizens should not pass away
      without some signal expression of the profound sense of bereavement which
      those fellow-citizens entertain; and
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas we represent that portion of the community with whom the
      lamented deceased peculiarly sympathized; therefore be it resolved by the
      General Committee,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>First</i>, That this melancholy event impressively teaches the
      solemn truth that in the midst of life we are in death;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Second</i> That in the brilliant talents, the rare
      accomplishments, the deep sagacity, the unswerving allegiance to principle
      which characterized our dear departed brother and associate, we recognize
      the qualities which would have rendered the progress of his career as
      triumphant as its opening was auspicious;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Third,</i> That while we humble ourselves before the mysterious
      will of Heaven, which works not as man works, we tender our most
      respectful and profound sympathy to the afflicted relatives and friends of
      the deceased, to whom we fervently pray that his memory may be as a lamp
      to the feet;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fourth,</i> That we will attend his funeral in a body; that we
      will wear crape upon the left arm for thirty days; and that a copy of
      these resolutions, signed by the officers of the Committee, shall be
      presented to his family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Mr. Condor, resuming his
      cigar, and laying the paper upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the thing,&rdquo; said General Belch. &ldquo;Just the thing.
      You know the Grant has passed and been approved?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so Ele wrote me,&rdquo; returned Mr. Condor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condor,&rdquo; continued the General, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough
      of it. I&rsquo;m going to back out. I&rsquo;d rather sweep the streets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Belch spoke emphatically, and his friend turned toward him with a
      pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you make so much in any other way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. But I&rsquo;d rather make less, and more comfortably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find it perfectly comfortable,&rdquo; replied William Condor.
      &ldquo;You take it too hard. You ought to manage it with less friction.
      The point is, to avoid friction. If you undertake to deal with men, you
      ought to understand just what they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Condor smoked serenely, and General Belch looked at his slim, clean
      figure, and his calm face, with curious admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-by,&rdquo; said Condor, &ldquo;when you introduce the
      resolutions, I shall second them with a few remarks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did so. At the meeting of the Committee he rose and enforced them
      with a few impressive and pertinent words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is instinctive in the human
      breast. When a man does well, or promises well, it is natural to regard
      him with interest and affection. The fidelity of our departed brother is
      worthy of our most affectionate admiration and imitation. If you ask me
      whether he had faults, I answer that he was a man. Who so is without sin,
      let him cast the first stone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day the Honorable B. Jawley Ele rose in his place in Congress
      to announce the calamity in which the whole country shared, and to move an
      adjournment in respect for the memory of his late colleague&mdash;&ldquo;a
      man endeared to us all by the urbanity of his deportment and his social
      graces; but to me especially, by the kindness of his heart and the
      readiness of his sympathy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel Newt was buried from his father&rsquo;s house. There were not many
      gathered at the service in the small, plain rooms. Fanny Dinks was there,
      sobered and saddened&mdash;the friend now of Hope Wayne, and of Amy, her
      Uncle Lawrence&rsquo;s wife. Alfred was there, solemnized and frightened.
      The office of Lawrence Newt &amp; Co. was closed, and the partners and the
      clerks all stood together around the coffin. Abel&rsquo;s mother, shrouded
      in black, sat in a dim corner of the room, nervously sobbing. Abel&rsquo;s
      father, sitting in his chair, his white hair hanging upon his shoulders,
      looked curiously at all the people, while his bony fingers played upon his
      knees, and he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all the solemn course of the service, from the gracious words,
      &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life,&rdquo; to the final Amen which
      was breathed out of the depth of many a soul there, the old man&rsquo;s
      eyes did not turn from the clergyman. But when, after a few moments of
      perfect silence, two or three men entered quietly and rapidly, and,
      lifting the coffin, began to bear it softly out of the room, he looked
      troubled and surprised, and glanced vaguely and inquiringly from one
      person to another, until, as it was passing out of the door, his face was
      covered with a piteous look of appeal: he half-rose from his chair, and
      reached out toward the door, with the long white fingers clutching in the
      air; but Hope Wayne took the wasted hands in hers, placed her arm behind
      him gently, and tenderly pressed him back into the chair. The old man
      raised his eyes to her as she stood by him, and holding one of her hands
      in one of his, the spectral calmness returned into his face; while,
      beating his thin knee with the other hand, he said, in the old way, as the
      body of his son was borne out of his house, &ldquo;Riches have wings!
      Riches have wings!&rdquo; But still he held Hope Wayne&rsquo;s hand, and
      from time to time raised his eyes to her face.

    <p>
      The hand which held that of old Boniface Newt was never placed in that of
      any, younger man, except for a moment; but the heart that warmed the hand
      henceforward held all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have come to the last leaf, patient and gentle reader, and the girl we
      saw sitting, long ago, upon the lawn and walking in the garden of Pinewood
      is not yet married! Yes, and we shall close the book, and still she will
      be Hope Wayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could we help it? How could a faithful chronicler but tell his story
      as it is? It is not at his will that heroes marry, and heroines are given
      in marriage. He merely watches events and records results; but the
      inevitable laws of human life are hidden in God&rsquo;s grace beyond his
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is Arthur Merlin painting pictures to this day, and every year with
      greater beauty and wider recognition. He wears the same velvet coat of
      many buttons&mdash;or its successor in the third or fourth remove&mdash;and
      still he whistles and sings at his work, still draws back from the easel
      and turns his head on one side to look at his picture, and cons it
      carefully through the tube of his closed hand; still lays down the pallet
      and, lighting a cigar, throws himself into the huge easy-chair, hanging
      one leg over the chair-arm and gazing, as he swings his foot, at something
      which does not seem to be in the room. Cheerful and gay, he has always a
      word of welcome for the loiterer who returns to Italy by visiting the
      painters; even if the loiterer find him with the foot idly swinging and
      the cigar musingly smoking itself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is the painter conscious of any gaping, unhealed wound that
      periodically bleeds. There are nights in mid-summer when, leaning from his
      window, he thinks of many things, and among others, of a picture he once
      painted of the legend of Latmos. He smiles to think that, at the time, he
      half persuaded himself that he might be Endymion, yet the feeling with
      which he smiles is of pity and wonder rather than of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Thanksgiving dinners, at Christmas parties, at New Year and Twelfth
      Night festivals, no guest so gay and useful, so inventive and delightful,
      as Arthur Merlin the painter. Just as Aunt Winnifred has abandoned her
      theory it has become true, and all the girls do seem to love the man who
      respects them as much as the younger men do with whom they nightly dance
      in winter. He romps with the children, has a perfectly regulated and
      triumphant sliding-scale of gifts and attentions; and only this Christmas,
      although he is now&mdash;well, Aunt Winnifred has locked up the Family
      Bible and begins to talk of Arthur as a young man&mdash;yet only this
      Christmas, at Lawrence Newt&rsquo;s family party, at which, so nimbly did
      they run round, it was almost impossible to compute the actual number of
      Newt, and Wynne, and Bennet children&mdash;Arthur Merlin brought in,
      during the evening, with an air of profound secrecy, something covered
      with a large handkerchief. Of course there could be no peace, and no
      blindman&rsquo;s-buff, no stage-coach, no twirling the platter, and no
      snap-dragon, until the mystery was revealed; The whole crowd of short
      frocks and trowsers, and bright ribbons, and eyes, and curls, swarmed
      around the painter until he displayed a green branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of tiny feet, carrying a pair of great blue eyes and a head of
      golden curls, scampered across the floor to Lawrence Newt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, what is that green thing with little berries on it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a misletoe bough, little Hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, papa, what&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter was already telling the children what it was for; and when he
      had hung it up over the folding-doors such a bubbling chorus of laughter
      and merry shrieks followed, there was such a dragging of little girls in
      white muslin by little boys in blue velvet, and such smacking, and
      kissing, and happy confusion, that the little Hope&rsquo;s curiosity was
      immediately relieved. Of all the ingenious inventions of their friend the
      painter, this of the misletoe was certainly the most transcendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Arthur Merlin himself joined the romp, and, chasing Hope Wayne
      through the lovely crowd of shouting girls and boys, finally caught her
      and led her to the middle of the room and dropped on one knee and kissed
      her hand under the misletoe, then the delight burst all bounds; and as
      Hope Wayne&rsquo;s bright, beautiful face glanced merrily around the room&mdash;bright
      and beautiful, although she is young no longer&mdash;she saw that the
      elders were shouting with the children, and that Lawrence Newt and his
      wife, and his niece Fanny, and papa and mamma Wynne, and Bennet, were all
      clapping their hands and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed too; and Arthur Merlin laughed; and when Ellen Bennet&rsquo;s
      oldest daughter (of whom there are certain sly reports, in which her name
      is coupled with that of her cousin Edward, May Newt&rsquo;s oldest son)
      sat down to the piano and played a Virginia reel, it was Arthur Merlin who
      handed out Hope Wayne with mock gravity, and stepped about and bowed
      around so solemnly, that little Hope Newt, sitting upon her papa&rsquo;s
      knee and nestling her golden curls among his gray hair, laughed all the
      time, and wished that Christmas came every day in the year, and that she
      might always see Mr. Arthur Merlin dancing with dear Aunt Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dance was over and the panting children were resting, Gabriel
      Newt, Lawrence&rsquo;s youngest boy, said to Arthur,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Merlin, what game shall we play now? What game do you like
      best?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game of life, my boy,&rdquo; replied Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pooh!&rdquo; said Gabriel, doubtfully, with a vague feeling
      that Mr. Merlin was quizzing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the painter was in earnest; and if you are of his opinion, patient and
      gentle reader, it is for you to say who, among all the players we have
      been watching, held Trumps.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
